            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR Letter was Read by none with Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Delight than my Self, to Conſider the Pitch of your Reaſoning, in a Cauſe ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant as this.</p>
            <p>And I Congratulate your Good Succeſs in the Words of King <hi>Lemuel. Many have done Nobly,</hi> to this Theam, <hi>but thou Excelleſt them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> Deſpis'd the Swarms of Pamphlets have hitherto come out againſt them; and made it their Sport to Toſs them like Chaff in the Air.</p>
            <p>But now, Sir, their Eyes are all Fix'd upon you, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Stage like <hi>Almanzor,</hi> they Buckle their Armor Cloſe, and bend all their Force againſt you. They Know, and Feel, that this Letter of yours is deſervedly Eſteem'd, by all in this Government, as the moſt Celebrated, and Top-Piece of the Party, and thought <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanſwerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it may Continue and Encreaſe its Reputation, it will be Neceſſary, that you, Sir, ſhould know, and Refute all the Poor Objections which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Start againſt it. Some of which I have gather'd together, for your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but more, that the Honor and Juſtice of the <hi>Preſent Government</hi> might, as far as poſſible, be Vindicated, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65103:3"/> even theſe fame <hi>Jacobites</hi> Reclaim'd; of which we have Reaſon to Conceive Great hopes, if you be able to Satisfy their Scruples.</p>

               <item>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their Arguments from <hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly, Matters of Fact,</hi> which they Charge upon this <hi>Government,</hi> and are to them an inſuperable Prejudice againſt it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Both theſe I have ſet down, Full and Broad, in their own Words, that you may miſs nothing of the Force of their Objections: And I hope you, Sir, nor any in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will take it. Amiſs from me, ſeeing I only Repeat their Words, and that in Order to the Neceſſary Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government: Which if you Perform, to Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <hi>(for you or none muſt do it)</hi> we will leave theſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> nothing to ſay, or nothing but what will Expoſe them.</p>
            <p>And let us Deal Fairly, and upon the Square with them, and hear the uttmoſt of their Defence, the ſooner we ſhall have done.</p>
            <p>And we need not fear to give them this Liberty, for, we can ſew the <hi>Jacobites</hi> in Bears Skins when we pleaſe, cry out upon them, Wou'd you have the <hi>French,</hi> wou'd you have <hi>Popery</hi> come in? We can eaſily make ſuch a Noiſe, as that they ſhall not be heard.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us Venture, for once, to give them a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: We do not ſuſpect them for any Inclinations to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> notwithſtanding of all this: On the Contrary, they were the Men who ſtood in the Gap againſt it, when it threatned us moſt, and are ſtill ready, and I doubt not wou'd be as forward as any, to do ſo again.</p>
            <p>Much leſs can they be ſuſpected to have faln out with the Country of <hi>England,</hi> ſo as to deſire the <hi>French</hi> might Conquer it. They have Eſtates, and wou'd be as loath to loſe them as other Men; and no doubt, love their <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> as much: And pretend as Great Regard, as any People, to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which, they ſay, do Juſtify them, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us, who Support <hi>this Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they plead greater things than theſe: The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65103:3"/> and <hi>His Expreſs Command;</hi> which, if true, will ſuperſede all our Arguments drawn from ſmaller Topicks. The People of <hi>Athens</hi> Rejected a Method which <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to them, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> Life of <hi>Ariſtides</hi>
               </note> much to their Advantage and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and which could be eaſily effected, upon the only account, becauſe it was not <hi>Juſt:</hi> And ſhall not <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſay theſe <hi>Jacobites;</hi> Depend as much upon the Protection of God, in their Obedience to His <hi>Reveal'd Will,</hi> as <hi>Heathens,</hi> upon their general notions of Juſtice, which were much more Fallible?</p>
            <p>They ſay that the Folly of God is Wiſer than men: He can bring Good out of Evil; and turn all the Seeming good and proſperity of the wicked into evil and miſchief upon their own heads. And therefore, that all your Politicks, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures what may happen, is not ſo ſure a Foundation for men to venture their Souls upon, as the <hi>Reveal'd Will</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſeem to bring the Matter to this Iſſue: That we muſt either Deny the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> or Anſwer their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections out of the <hi>Scripture:</hi> And they ſeem very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, that the firſt of theſe will be choſen: That it is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by too many already.</p>
            <p>They ſay, there are Examples in all Ages, of men going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their viſible <hi>Intereſt,</hi> to preſerve a Good <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They tell you of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, who fought for her againſt Q. <hi>Jane,</hi> a Woman of vaſt Endowments of mind, and a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That theſe Proteſtants had as ſad a proſpect in what they did, as can be ſuppos'd in the Reſtoration of K. <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may ſay that they met with it accordingly: Q. <hi>Mary</hi> broke her word to them, and perſecuted them with Fire and Faggot.</p>
            <p>But this will be no Argument againſt the <hi>Jacobites;</hi> for they ſay, that the Proteſtants did their Duty, in adhering to Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> elſe they had been <hi>Rebels,</hi> and not <hi>Martyrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That her <hi>Perſecution</hi> prov'd infinitely to the Good and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, which has liv'd Great, and in Reputation with all the world ever ſince, upon the Fund of that Loyal and Chriſtian Principle of <hi>Non-Reſiſtence.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:65103:4"/> And they ſay, that the <hi>Church of England</hi> has Suffer'd more, by forſaking that Principle now, than She cou'd have done by a <hi>Perſecution,</hi> which wou'd ſtill have added to her Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>They call themſelves the only ſtay that has kept the <hi>Church of England</hi> from ſinking utterly in the opinion of all good Chriſtians, by their preſent Suffering for that Old Doctrine of their Church, <hi>Non-Reſiſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay, That a Church is more Deſtroyed by the loſs of her <hi>Principles,</hi> than of her <hi>Livings:</hi> Pureneſs of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> not <hi>Outward Pomp,</hi> or <hi>Legal Eſtabliſhments,</hi> denominate a True and a Holy Church.</p>
            <p>They ſay, <hi>Rebellion</hi> brings greater Deſtruction than <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> That not <hi>three hundred</hi> ſuffered, during Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s <hi>five</hi> years Reign: That a <hi>thouſand</hi> times as many have periſh'd within theſe <hi>three</hi> years in <hi>Ireland,</hi> beſides thoſe have been loſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> and in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, were in much more Deplorable Circumſtances, than we were in K. <hi>Jame</hi>'s time: He was well advanced in years, when he came to the Crown, and the three next Heirs <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Q. <hi>Mary</hi> a young Woman, Married to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth</hi> declared to be Illegitimate, by Act of Parliament, and ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> in order to a further ſecurity: And after her, the <hi>Royal Line</hi> run out of ſight into <hi>Popiſh Families.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Reformation</hi> was but young and tender then in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> The Parliament were <hi>papiſts,</hi> and <hi>popery</hi> ſet up as the <hi>Eſtabliſht Religion;</hi> and all places <hi>Eccleſiaſtical, Civil</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary</hi> were put into the <hi>papiſts</hi> hands.</p>
            <p>In K. <hi>James</hi>'s time, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were <hi>two hundred</hi> to <hi>one papiſt;</hi> and he could never have got a <hi>Popiſh Parliament.</hi> The K. of <hi>Spain</hi> was then as Formidable to <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>French King</hi> is now; and had much greater pretence: He was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to our <hi>Queen,</hi> and all our Acts of Parliament were in his name; he was ſtil'd <hi>King of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were great Objections againſt Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Title to the Crown. The validity of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII's Marriage with her Mother was diſputed all over Chriſtendom; and the whole Nation was Sworn, by Act of Parliament, to adhere
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65103:4"/> to the Iſſue of Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> who was Mother to the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> 26 <hi>Hen,</hi> VIII. <hi>C.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Yet all this notwithſtanding, neither did that <hi>Proteſtant Princeſs</hi> pretend to the Crown; neither did the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> contend for her, during her Elder Siſters Life; tho' it was given out, That there was a Deſign of impoſing a Falſe Son upon the Nation, to Cut off the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who was next Heir to the Crown: Publick Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings having been thro' the Nation, for Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s being with child; and ſome fooliſh <hi>Friars,</hi> even in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, giving out before hand, That it muſt be a <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> which their Pryaers had obtain'd, to prevent a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Succeſſor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But none of theſe things had any Witch-craft then, in that ſober age of <hi>Proteſtancy,</hi> to prevall with the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to lift up a hand againſt the Right of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> tho' a <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> had paſt againſt her, in her Fathers time; and the Nation had ſworn to adhere to the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the next <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Heir; (But they did not think their Oaths ought to bind them againſt the Right) and notwithſtanding that Queen <hi>Mary</hi> did plainly, and without any Diſguiſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Defeat her Siſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Succeſſion to the Crown; having firſt got an Act of Parliament to Eſtabliſh her own Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimacy, and conſequently, to throw off her Siſter as Illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, She had ſent her Siſter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the Tower, in order, as was generally believ'd, to Cut off her Head: <hi>Speed</hi> tells, That a Warrant was once Sign'd for her Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet not to Reſcue her, nor to Aſſert her Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, nor for any other cauſe whatſoever, wou'd our Loyal <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Fore-Fathers take Arms againſt the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Queen, either in behalf of this Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or of Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> another <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> againſt whom they Fought to ſet up Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> And thought they conſulted beſt in ſo doing, for the preſervation of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> by aſſerting its <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> tho' to the Loſs of its <hi>Legal Eſtabliſhment,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (viſible) worldly Advantages.</p>
            <p>Theſe things the <hi>Jacobites</hi> urge: And they Glory in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful protection which GOD, at that time, ſhew'd towards
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65103:5"/> theſe <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in their Faith and Dependance upon Him; turning all the whole Scheme to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> advantage; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away Q. <hi>Mary</hi> without their Guilt, and giving her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd Siſter <hi>Forty Four</hi> years Poſſeſſion of her Throne, to Eſtabliſh, Adorn, and make Glorious, that poor, deſpis'd, and perſecuted Principle of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They tell us likewiſe of the Caſe of <hi>Theudas,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 5.36,37.) who took Arms againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> in Defence, both of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</hi> It was againſt the grievous <hi>Taxing</hi> which was then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>Judas</hi> roſe in Arms, and <hi>Drew away much people after him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſay, That all the Declamations in this <hi>Letter to a Friend,</hi> againſt the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> will hold <hi>as ſtrongly</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s time: But <hi>much more ſtrongly</hi> againſt <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and other <hi>Jews,</hi> who Condemn'd <hi>Theudas</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> in behalf of their Lawful Governours, the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were profeſt <hi>Heathens, Idolaters, Deſpiſers,</hi> and <hi>Perſecutors</hi> of the <hi>Law of Moſes;</hi> yet Fighting againſt them, tho' in Defence of the True Faith, was inferr'd to be Fighting <hi>againſt God,</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 5.39.) And <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not be Defended by Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Heathen Magiſtrate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame do the <hi>Jabobites</hi> think of fighting <hi>for a Religion,</hi> in a Caſe, which <hi>that Religion</hi> does not allow to be a Good Cauſe of fighting for it: They think this to be fighting <hi>againſt that Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, If we ſhould fight to the viſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the <hi>outward profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Legal Eſtabliſhment</hi> of our Religion, in purſuance of a <hi>Principle</hi> of that Religion. This the <hi>Jacobites</hi> would call a fighting <hi>for our Religion:</hi> That is, To Maintain, Aſſert, and Honour the <hi>Principles</hi> of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, (which only are the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> part of Religion) tho' to the Loſs of <hi>Temporal advantages,</hi> and <hi>outward ornament:</hi> (which are but the <hi>Out-ſide,</hi> and <hi>Trappings</hi> of Religion.) Therefore they go not upon the <hi>Outward advantages,</hi> but upon the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> of their Cauſe; for the love of which they have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all their <hi>Outward Advantages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, they ſay, That unleſs you can prove their Principles to be <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> all you Argue againſt them is againſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65103:5"/> the <hi>Law of God,</hi> againſt <hi>Juſtice,</hi> againſt <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion:</hi> And that <hi>Humane politicks</hi> are too weak to over-ballance all theſe.</p>
            <p>Nay, they pretend, that even <hi>Humane policy,</hi> and the <hi>Good of the Nation</hi> is on their ſide.</p>
            <p>That K. <hi>James</hi>'s Tyranny (ſuppoſe it as bad as you will) would not have Coſt the Nation ſo many <hi>Lives,</hi> ſo much <hi>Money,</hi> nor been ſo hard to be Redreſt, after his Death, as the preſent Revolution.</p>
            <p>Now they complain, That all this is not ſufficiently An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in this <hi>Letter to a Friend,</hi> where it ſayes, <hi>page</hi> 28. (which is all the Anſwer given to it in that <hi>Letter</hi>) that, <hi>If they,</hi> (the Jacobites) <hi>ſay they would fight for him,</hi> (K. J.) <hi>I give them over,</hi> (ſayes the Letter) <hi>as profeſs'd Enemies to the True Religion, and the Liberties of Man-kind.</hi> And, <hi>This I hope,</hi> (ſayes the Letter) <hi>may ſatisſy the Non-ſwearers, that they are not bound in Conſcience to Fight for the late King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now theſe perverſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> do ſay, That they can ſee no Reaſon why the Author of this Letter's <hi>Giving them over,</hi> ſhould be a Satisfaction to their Conſciences:</p>
            <p>They call this <hi>Scolding,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Anſwering:</hi> Whereas they pretend that their Principle is purſuant to the <hi>True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and moſt for the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of Man kind, to Save men from the Great Deſtruction of <hi>Civil-War</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> which, they ſay, is infinitely of more miſchief to man kind, than any <hi>Tyranny</hi> ever was in the world.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>Religion</hi> loſes more Ground, and leſſens more in the Opinion of man-kind, by a change of <hi>principles,</hi> which have been long profeſs'd, than by ſuffering <hi>perſecution,</hi> in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thoſe <hi>Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things they think a full and ſufficient Anſwer to all this whole <hi>Letter to a Friend:</hi> And therefore do <hi>inſult</hi> and <hi>rejoyce,</hi> that no Anſwer is poſſible to be given to them; ſince this <hi>Beſt Anſwer,</hi> which is yet come out, has not one word againſt the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Honeſty</hi> of their Principles; only argues from <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> that may attend them, which is incident to the beſt actions in the world, eſpecially, if <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> have any Truth in it.</p>
            <p>And therefore I do earneſtly Adviſe, in behalf of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65103:6"/> Government, that the Ingenious Author of this <hi>Letter to a Friend,</hi> would ſtudy ſomthing to be ſaid as to the <hi>Truth, Honeſty,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Revolution,</hi> leſt the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> Triumph!</p>
            <p>But I muſt not forget one thing, which the <hi>Letter to a Friend</hi> (pag. 5/6) does mainly Inſiſt upon, as the Chief Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment why, if K. <hi>James</hi> ſhould Return, we were to expect no Mercy from him, which is, his Barbarous treatment of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> after he went over thither, in the year 88/89.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> are Glad that they have got this hold againſt Us; for they inſiſt upon it, That K. <hi>James</hi> ſhew'd, not only <hi>Great Lenity</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> but <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Concern</hi> for the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> while he was there, inſomuch, that they can hardly inſtance any Requeſt ever they made to him, which was deny'd. He was ſo far from Diſobliging them, that he really <hi>Courted</hi> them, to the no ſmall Diſturbance of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who thought themſelves not ſo much Regarded, as their Merit (in their own conceit) above that of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> did require.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> Appeal, in this, to the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives</hi> of the Chief Towns in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> (which was the only part of the Kingdom, where they ſtood out in Arms againſt K. <hi>James,</hi> viz. <hi>Derry,</hi> and <hi>Enesk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llen</hi>) and among them <hi>Belfaſt</hi> was the Richeſt, and moſt populous of any of the Cityes in the <hi>North:</hi> And conſequently, which had moſt occaſion to make application to the Government, upon ſeveral Emergencies.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do put it upon that Iſſue, that the then <hi>Sovereign</hi> of <hi>Belfaſt</hi> (who was, and is ſtill an unſuſpected <hi>Proteſtant</hi>) will not ſay, that one of the many Addreſſes to K. J. was rejected, or not fully and readily Anſwered, which he made in behalf of that <hi>Town,</hi> or of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in thoſe parts of the Country: And that the Orders, which K. J. gave upon theſe addreſſes of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> were not duely and punctually obſerv'd; and where any Breaches were made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (who were very ill pleas'd with them) which was but ſeldom, they were not ſeverely Puniſh'd for it; as far as K. J<hi>'s.</hi> power did extend. But as it was, he made
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65103:6"/> theſe his Protections very effectual to the <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> And this will be juſtified, not only at <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> but by the Reſt of the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and other Men of Note in all the <hi>North,</hi> and in the whole Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> during K. <hi>J</hi>'s being among them.</p>
            <p>And this the <hi>Jacobites</hi> are poſitive in, notwithſtanding all that is endeavour'd in a late Book, call'd, <hi>The State of the Proteſtants of</hi> Ireland, <hi>under the late K.</hi> James's <hi>Government,</hi> &amp;c. which they pretend to Diſprove in <hi>Matter of Fact;</hi> and ſay, They would expoſe it to the world, if any, who think the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, wou'd, for a Tryal, obtain for them the Liberty of the <hi>Preſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Generoſity wou'd become the <hi>Author;</hi> that he might Fight his Adverſary upon Equal Terms.</p>
            <p>But, in the mean time, till that can be done, they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it (and I am ſorry to find that they have the ſuffrage of the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants</hi> here, and even of the <hi>Engliſh Army</hi> which went over thither) That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> Suffered more; and the Country was more Ruin'd by K. <hi>W.</hi>'s Army, than by K. <hi>J.</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>They tell us, from the Mouths of Gentlemen, coming over every day from thence, That laſt <hi>Winter</hi> there was a great <hi>Famine</hi> in that Country, the poor <hi>Iriſh</hi> being ſuffer'd to Starve in the High-ways, eating dead Horſes, and Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>This I had from ſeveral Gentlemen, who have ſeen it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> infer from this: That the Conſequences of that War are not over, as yet, in that <hi>Kingdom;</hi> no, nor in this: For who can tell the Iſſue of the preſent War with <hi>France?</hi> when our <hi>Taxes</hi> will be at an end? and whether it be not poſſible that <hi>England</hi> may be Drain'd as poor as <hi>Ireland?</hi> They ſay, we are ingag'd in a Conteſt, like that of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> which laſted above a <hi>hundred</hi> years, and Rooted out many of the Noble Families of <hi>England,</hi> with vaſt Conſumption of Blood and Treaſure.</p>
            <p>They ſay; That when all this is put into the Scales, it will infinitely out weigh all the Frightful Apprehenſions of <hi>K. J.</hi>'s Reign.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65103:7"/>
            <p>And conſequently, that his Return would be the Greateſt <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to this Nation: That nothing he can be fancy'd to do in the ſhort Remainder of his Reign, carryes any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Continuance of this War to our Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>And they ſay, That his Mild and Gentle Carriage towards the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> when as many of them as could; to a very ſmall number, were in actual Rebellion againſt him, and they were the moſt bitter and implacable Enemies he had, and are ſo ſtill: They ſay, that his Tenderneſs, and Preſervation of theſe, under all theſe provoking Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is a great ſpecimen of his Nature, and what we might expect from him, if he ſhould Return again into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But chiefly for this Reaſon, That if he came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> his Intereſt would be to preſerve <hi>England:</hi> and with all his objected Faults, I think none ever doubted, but that he alwayes endeavoured what he thought was for the Good of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other hand, it was certainly his <hi>Intereſt</hi> to have <hi>Deſtroy'd,</hi> at leaſt to have <hi>Diſabled</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> becauſe he was morally aſſured they would Joyn with <hi>K. W.</hi> when he came over; which they did as ſoon as they were able, and were the men, who had the chief hand in the Victories abtain'd againſt <hi>K. J.</hi> at the <hi>Boyn, Athlone, Agram,</hi> &amp;c. and of whom the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were moſt afraid, as Doctor <hi>Gorge,</hi> Secretary to <hi>Schomberg,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Witneſſes under his hand.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>K. J.</hi> had Deſtroy'd theſe Enemies of his (the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Proteſtants</hi>) when it was in his Power, for a whole <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> together, he had not, in probability, been Driven out of <hi>Ireland</hi> to this day; at leaſt you will Grant me, that it had not been ſo eaſily done.</p>
            <p>Now Conſider, ſay theſe <hi>Jacobites,</hi> If <hi>K. J.</hi>'s Good Nature, tho' Baited by all the violence of the <hi>Friars,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who would fain have Deſtroyed theſe <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to Secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: If All this, and his own viſible Security (for who would not Deſtroy his Enemies!) could not prevail upon his natural Goodneſs and Clemency; to Suffer, or Connive
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65103:7"/> at the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> (for it needed not have appeared to be <hi>His</hi> Act) to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy theſe <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> What Malice can Suggeſt, that it was his <hi>Deſign</hi> to Deſtroy them?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſpeak not in this of all the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> they ſay, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Deny that many of them have Approv'd themſelves <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Gallant</hi> Men; not only in <hi>Foraign</hi> Countrys, but now at <hi>Home,</hi> where, tho' <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-Diſciplin'd, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>narm'd,</hi> bred many Ages in <hi>Servitude,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nacquainted with War,</hi> yet, without Aid of any <hi>Foraign Troops</hi> (except at the <hi>Boyne</hi>) made ſuch Defence, as Oblig'd K. <hi>William,</hi> in Perſon, to Raiſe the Siege of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and Employ'd the whole Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>England,</hi> Aſſiſted with the beſt Troops of the <hi>Dutch, Danes, Brandenburgers,</hi> and <hi>French Refugees,</hi> for <hi>Three</hi> Years together. But there is among the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as, <hi>among our Selves,</hi> a <hi>Violent</hi> and <hi>Bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Party: And the <hi>Jacobites</hi> tell us, that when <hi>ſome of theſe,</hi> Propos'd to K. <hi>James,</hi> that they would Rid him of the Fear of thoſe <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants,</hi> who were in <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt him, if he would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Connive</hi> at it, and not interpoſe on their behalf, his Majeſty heard it with Horror, and Indignation, and ſaid, <hi>What! Gentlemen, are you for another Forty One?</hi> And that he Watch'd over the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to Preſerve them, and did Preſerve them; even at that time, when they, who had been thus <hi>Protected</hi> by him, and had <hi>Sworn</hi> Fidelity <hi>Anew</hi> to him, Roſe up, as one Man, againſt him, when <hi>Schomberg</hi> Landed with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 89.</p>
            <p>And when, upon <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s Approach, K. <hi>James</hi>'s Army were Obliged to remove nearer <hi>Dublin,</hi> even <hi>Then,</hi> he gave ſtrict Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Major General <hi>Maxwel</hi> to preſerve <hi>Belfaſt, Lisburn,</hi> and other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Towns which they left to the Enemy, from being either Burned, or Plundered by the Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Which Towns, if <hi>Schomberg,</hi> had wanted for his Winter Quarters, inſtead of <hi>Ten Thouſand</hi> Men whom he Buried at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> he might have left the greateſt part of his Army there <hi>under Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the next Day after the <hi>Boyne,</hi> when K. <hi>James</hi> left <hi>Dublin,</hi> he gave poſitive Orders, and his great Care was, to Save that City from being Burned, or the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Plundered.</p>
            <p>Which, had it been done, in all probability, the Reduction of <hi>Ireland</hi> had been prevented, at leaſt, for a much longer time, than that, which (by the Convenience, and Accommodation of theſe Towns, which <hi>K. J.</hi> ſpar'd) <hi>K. W.</hi> took to Effect it.</p>
            <p>From all this, theſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> do Urge, That if <hi>K. J.</hi> took ſuch pains to preſerve his <hi>Enemies,</hi> under the greateſt provocations, what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man can think that he would ſeek to Deſtroy <hi>England,</hi> if
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65103:8"/> it were his own, and he in quiet Poſſeſſion of it? And therefore the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do inſiſt, That it muſt needs be the Intereſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to call Home <hi>K. J.</hi> rather than run the hazard of his Forcing his Way, while he deſires nothing ſo much, as to Return, without Blood, by the Invitation of his People, and not by the <hi>Exceſſive</hi> Power of <hi>France;</hi> with whom we are now at War, upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Account than that of their aſſerting the Right of <hi>K. J.</hi> And the Iſſue of War, who can tell? Sure, we do not think it impoſſible, that <hi>France</hi> may Conquer us!</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> in his Thanksgiving Sermon, laſt 29. of <hi>May,</hi> Thinks our Deliverance from the <hi>French,</hi> this <hi>Summer,</hi> ſo Miraculous, that he could find nothing to Compare it to, but the Deliverance of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> And the <hi>Impartial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry int othe Cauſes of the preſent Fears and Dangers of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> Page 2. ſays, <q rend="inline">Had not the Good God prevented that Fleet's (the <hi>French Fleet</hi>) coming by contrary Winds for <hi>Five Weeks together,</hi> they had certainly compaſs'd their Deſign, before any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets could have been at Sea, or made the leaſt Oppoſition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And it is as certain, that if the <hi>French Fleet</hi> had made their Full Advantage, of the Victory they obtain'd over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets, in the Year 90. If they had but Burnt the Tranſport Ships, which were then attending <hi>K. W.</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and carrying the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for his Army, in which they could have met with no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; there is none now but ſees, that if they had done this, they had Deſtroy'd us at that time; it was perſectly in their Power; and they were Advertis'd of it.</p>
            <p>Now ſome <hi>Jacobites</hi> would have us believe, That the <hi>French</hi> King would not have loſt that Advantage, and ſuffer'd his Fleet to Ride Victorious, a whole Month together, upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſt, without attempting to Burn their Ships, or do them the leaſt Injury; if it had not been for K. <hi>James</hi>'s interpoſing, on behalf of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and to Save their <hi>Fleet;</hi> From the ſame Principle which made him Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> when he was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſet out any <hi>Privateers,</hi> (which they offered on their own Expence,) to Diſturb the Trade of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and he would not permit any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, which came to <hi>Ireland,</hi> while he was there, to be Seiz'd, but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to Load and Unload, and purſue their Voyages, of which there were ſeveral Inſtances.</p>
            <p>And he ſhew'd ſo much Concern, for the Loſs and Diſgrace of that part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet at <hi>BANTRY,</hi> where they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65103:9"/> were worſted by the <hi>French,</hi> that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> took great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at it; like that of <hi>Joab</hi> againſt <hi>David,</hi> for Mourning at his Victory over <hi>Abſalom:</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſaid, That the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> had his <hi>Heart,</hi> they had only his <hi>Preſence</hi> among them.</p>
            <p>He cannot be got off that Opinion, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are to be Won by Good Nature, tho' his FATHER Loſt his Head, and himſelf <hi>Three</hi> Crowns, in trying the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if he perſwaded K. <hi>L.</hi> to Try it once more; we can impute it to nothing but his Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Thus ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and their Story has ſo much pretence, that it is hard for us to Aſſign any other Reaſon, why the <hi>French Fleet</hi> lay perfectly Idle, and made no uſe at all of their Victory in the Year 90. At leaſt to Burn the Tranſport Ships in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which would have Ruined us abſolutely, and kept K. <hi>W.</hi> a Priſoner there. Which, if true, may be put among the <hi>Miracles</hi> have been ſhewn for our Preſervation: Firſt, A Miracle of good Nature in K. <hi>J.</hi> to be an Advocate for his Enemies; and a no leſs Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Complaiſance in K. <hi>Lew.</hi> to Loſe the Benefit of a Victory, which might have put him out of danger, of the Advantage our <hi>Fleet</hi> have had againſt him in 92.</p>
            <p>But inſtead of that, the <hi>French Fleet</hi> lay as if they had been Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Shore, landing at <hi>Haſtings</hi> in a Friendly manner, and ſpending their Money amongſt us, but hurting no body: They ſhew'd us their <hi>Humanity,</hi> after we had Try'd their <hi>Courage:</hi> If this was not Natural to the <hi>French,</hi> the Miracle is the greater; and whence ſhould it proceed, but from K. <hi>J.</hi> ſay the <hi>Jacobites?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe it to be as ſome of us do imagine, That the <hi>French</hi> King, being perfectly Maſter of his Buſineſs at home, does on purpoſe delay Reſtoring K. <hi>J.</hi> till K. <hi>W.</hi> has by this War drain'd us of all our Money, and it be then out of our Power to Force K. <hi>J.</hi> when Reſtor'd, to Joyn in <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy</hi> againſt <hi>France:</hi> Which is a Notion ſome have ſet up of late: Suppoſe, I ſay, that theſe ſhould be the <hi>French</hi> King's Meaſures, then the <hi>Jacobites</hi> tell us, that the more Money we give to K. <hi>William,</hi> the more we are doing the <hi>French</hi> King's buſineſs for him: And that unleſs we can Conquer him at Land, of which we have but a very ſlender proſpect, it is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65103:10"/> certain he muſt Drain us, if he can make us continue on the War. And therefore, that he deſires we ſhould give <hi>ſeven</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> Millions more next Seſſions: If he did not, there are ſome who tell us, that it is in his power to hinder it, even by Bribing the <hi>Parliament Men.</hi> We all know what a Noiſe the <hi>French Penſioners</hi> made in King <hi>Charles</hi> the II's <hi>Parliaments;</hi> and we remember ſince the <hi>French Faction</hi> were the Major Number among the <hi>Burgers</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let no Man ſuppoſe it an impoſſible thing that men may be Brib'd to Deſtroy their own Country, there are Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it in all Ages. <hi>Jugurtha</hi> Brib'd the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to have ſold their Country, if he could have found a Merchant. <hi>Vidit urbem quam venalem &amp; quandoque Perituram, ſi habuiſſet Emptorem — cecinerat. L. Flor.</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 1. and we believe the <hi>French Monarch</hi> to be as <hi>Powerful,</hi> as <hi>Rich,</hi> and as <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> as <hi>Jugurtha</hi> King of <hi>Numidia</hi> in <hi>Africk;</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> as Great and Brave, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> themſelves; and their <hi>Senate</hi> as Zealous of <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> as our <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> all this is prevented, and theſe Deſigns of the <hi>French</hi> King's (if theſe be his Deſigns) are totally fruſtrated, if we take Home our King: Then we ſhall preſerve our ſelves a conſiderable People, and <hi>True Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſtill; whom nothing but a <hi>Miracle</hi> can Ruine, while it continues upon its Old Foundations of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nalienable Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Monarchy:</hi> But in this Hurricane and Earth-Quake of State, which has ſet us upon <hi>Original Contract,</hi> and the <hi>Election</hi> of any Prevailing Faction, who call themſelves, <hi>The People</hi> (who the <hi>Jure-Divino-men</hi> ſay never were, and it is impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable ever ſhould be truly Repreſented) they tell us, our ſelves do confeſs, that nothing but <hi>Miracle</hi> has Preſerv'd us hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and they ſay, by the ſame reaſon, that <hi>Miracle</hi> muſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us, if the War does continue.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch MOB</hi> (tho' all our Money is ſpent among them) are crying for Peace, and will get Peace before us: They think all thoſe to be <hi>French Penſioners</hi> who are for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War, and now and then mind them of the Fate of the <hi>De-Witts.</hi> Trade is the Circulation of their Blood; and if a Sufficient Stock be not Preſerv'd, all other Receits are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65103:10"/> uſeleſs: We muſt not Bleed our ſelves to weak; if we ſtop not while we have Money in our hands, it will be too late after: And it will be a <hi>Miracle</hi> indeed if <hi>Jugurtha</hi> do not then find a Merchant for us.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Jacobites</hi> deſire us to Reflect what a Condition we are in, when we muſt truſt to <hi>Miracles</hi> every Year to Save us out of the hands of the <hi>French?</hi> Is this a Nation to be Deſpis'd? Is there no hazard to be apprehended from them?</p>
            <p>But if we can Secure our ſelves, and have their Peace and Friendſhip upon no harder terms, than to Receive our Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Natural KING, which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, Is our Duty by the Laws of GOD and Man; Then they Appeal to every True and Senſible <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> whether they do not ſeek the Good of <hi>England,</hi> more than thoſe who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch an expenſive and dangerous War, wherein they cannot hope to proſper if they Fight in oppoſition to the <hi>Reveal'd Will of God;</hi> and whether they do or not, in the preſent oppoſition to K. <hi>J.</hi> the <hi>Jacobites</hi> deſire no more, than that we ſhould Diſpute with them upon that Head.</p>
            <p>Now whether our Lives, and Religious Converſation be ſuch, as that we ought to expect that God ſhould <hi>Work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> to Reſcue us, rather than <hi>ſend a Rod,</hi> to Scourge us for our unexampled Looſneſs and Prophanity (not to name what they eall <hi>Rebellion,</hi> in the preſent Caſe) the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, is a Conſideration worth our moſt ſerious Thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jamaica</hi> is now ſtruck with an aſtoniſhing Perdition: And except we Repent — (<hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3.) The <hi>Jacobites</hi> wiſh this may not be a Fore-runner of Judgments to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Relations of that <hi>Earth-Quake</hi> from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> do ſpeak of the mighty Looſneſs and Prophanity of that Country, eſpecially of <hi>Port-Royal,</hi> where the Judgment fell moſt heavily; and that there were ſeveral ſmall motions of the Earth (ſuch as we had on the 8th. of this <hi>Sept.</hi> 92. in <hi>London,</hi> and other parts of <hi>England:</hi>) Some weeks before that dreadful Overthrow, wherein the Earth opened her mouth, and ſwallowed up Houſes and Churches; and Men deſcended (like <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi>) with their Wives, Children, and all that appertained to them, alive into the Pit. And the <hi>Jacobites</hi> deſire us to Obſerve, that this was for <hi>Rebellion</hi> in the <hi>State</hi> (of <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65103:11"/> with <hi>Two Hundred</hi> and <hi>Fifty</hi> Princes of the Aſſembly, Famous in the Congregation, Men of Renown, againſt <hi>Moſes</hi>) and for <hi>Schiſme</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> (of <hi>Korah,</hi> and <hi>Two Hundred</hi> and <hi>Fifty Levites</hi> againſt <hi>Aaron,</hi> their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Superiour</hi> and <hi>Metropolitan</hi>) and they got the Generality of the People on their ſide: For it is ſaid, That <hi>Korah</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <hi>All the Congregation</hi> againſt them (<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>) <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.19. And as this Deſtruction of <hi>Korah,</hi> &amp;c. did not Convert the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> for (<hi>ver.</hi> 41.) <hi>On the morrow all the Congregation</hi> were gathered againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> So we are told from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> That they were Robbing the Houſes, which were ſinking, and themſelves with them: And that the Boldneſs and Impudence of the <hi>Proſtitutes</hi> there, is nothing abated. How far <hi>London</hi> does Equal or Exceed <hi>Fort-Royal</hi> in theſe Sins, eſpecially in a Hardneſs of Heart, and Inſenſibility of God's Judgments, and contempt of His Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and that chiefly among the Gentry, and better ſort, of more free and generous Education, of which, they think it a part to ridicule and deſpiſe all that is <hi>Sacred;</hi> Or, how far we ought to reckon the Puniſhment of <hi>Jamaica</hi> to be our own, ſince they are part of us, and learn'd their Sins from us, I leave to the Meditation of the <hi>Reader:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whom I would have likewiſe obſerve, that tho' <hi>Earth-Quakes</hi> are leſs frequent in <hi>England;</hi> than in thoſe Hotter Climates, yet God has often ſhewn us, we are not Exempt from that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; of which we have frequent inſtances in our Hiſtories, even of the like dreadful Effects, as that in <hi>Jamaica.</hi> In the 13 Year of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the 17 of <hi>Feb.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi> tells of a prodigious <hi>Earth-Quake,</hi> which happned in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> part of <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> at a little Town, call'd <hi>Kinnaſton,</hi> where a Hill, with a Rock under it, lifted it ſelf up a great height, and travel'd from <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Evening, till <hi>Monday</hi> Noon, with Trees, Cattle, and all things upon it, leaving a Gaping diſtance <hi>Forty</hi> Foot broad, and <hi>Eighty</hi> Ells long, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturning Churches, Houſes, removing Trees, Hedges, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, made Tilled ground Paſture, and turned Paſture into Tillage. That on the 24. <hi>May,</hi> in the <hi>Sixth</hi> Year of <hi>Rich.</hi> the 11. there happened ſo great an <hi>Earth-Quake,</hi> that it made Ships in the Havens, to beat one againſt another. That
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65103:11"/> on <hi>Chriſtmaſs-Day,</hi> in the 24. year of <hi>Hen.</hi> the II. in the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Derlington,</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> the Earth lifted up it ſelf, in manner of an High Tower, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unmovable, from Morning till Evening, and then fell with ſo horrible a Noiſe, that it frighted the Inhabitants thereabouts; and the Earth ſwallowing it up, made there a deep Pit, which is ſeen at this day: For a Teſtimony where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Leyland</hi> ſaith, he ſaw the Pits there, commonly call'd, <hi>Hell-Kettles.</hi> And next year, the 25. of his Reign, the year of Chriſt, 1180. a Great <hi>Earth-Quake</hi> threw down many Buildings, amongſt which, the Cathedral Church of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was Rent in pieces the 25. of <hi>April:</hi> And that in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> I. The Earth moved with ſo great violence, that many Buildings were ſhaken down.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Malmesbury</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Houſe</hi> wherein he ſate, was lifted up with a Double remove; and at the <hi>Third</hi> time Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led again in the proper place: Alſo in divers places it yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded forth a hideous Noiſe, and caſt forth Flames at certain Rifts, many days together; which neither by water, nor by any other means could be ſuppreſſed.</p>
            <p>There are other <hi>Earth-Quakes</hi> Recorded, and Prodigious Signs in <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1165. 12 <hi>H.</hi> II. <hi>An.</hi> 1276. III <hi>Edw. An.</hi> 1428. 5. <hi>H.</hi> VI. and <hi>An.</hi> 1580. 22 <hi>Eliz.</hi> an <hi>Earth-quake</hi> cauſed the Great Bell at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to ſtrike againſt the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſeveral other Clock-Bells both in <hi>London</hi> and the Country; a piece of the <hi>Temple Church</hi> fell down; and ſome Stexes fell off from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church in <hi>London,</hi> and St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> divers Chimneys loſt their Tops; and Ships on the <hi>Thames,</hi> and on the <hi>Seas,</hi> were ſeen to Totter by this <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> as we are told in the <hi>Licenſed</hi> Account of the <hi>Earth-quakes</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſince the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Fourth</hi> year of King <hi>William</hi> the II. on Saint <hi>Luke</hi>'s day, above <hi>Six hundred</hi> Houſes in <hi>London</hi> were thrown down with Tempeſt; and the Roof of Saint <hi>Mary le Bow</hi> Church, in <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> was ſo raiſed, that in the Fall, <hi>ſix</hi> of the Beams (being <hi>twenty ſeven</hi> foot long) were driven ſo deep into the Ground (the Streets not being pav'd with ſtone) that not above <hi>four</hi> foot remain'd in fight.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65103:12"/>
            <p>This brings into my mind the violent Storm that happened, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 12. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 89/90. about <hi>two</hi> a Clock in the Morning, which blew down ſeveral Houſes in <hi>London,</hi> and tore up by the roots, and ſplit to the Ground, and broke off in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, above <hi>forty</hi> of the Old Elmes in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Park: And which was followed by that <hi>Hurricane</hi> K. <hi>W.</hi> carry'd into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, five</hi> Months after, in <hi>June</hi> 90. which ſpilt an Ocean of Blood, and Ruined that Flouriſhing Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Add to this the Dreadful <hi>Thunder</hi> on the 12. <hi>Aug.</hi> following, which <hi>London</hi> yet remembers with Aſtoniſhment, having not in this Age (if ever) Heard the Like before; it Tore down the great Wooden Crown over the Gate of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Pallace, which faces St. <hi>James</hi>'s ſtreet: And many do take Notice, That this 12. of <hi>Aug.</hi> 92. and laſt 12. of <hi>Aug.</hi> 91. there was unuſually Great <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning,</hi> tho' not Equal to that of 12. <hi>Aug.</hi> 90.</p>
            <p>I will not go out of my way to Diſcourſe of <hi>Brognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> as there is a <hi>Superſtitious</hi> uſe of them, there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a <hi>Religious.</hi> The Lights of Heaven were Ordain'd for <hi>Signs,</hi> as well as for <hi>Seaſons,</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14.) and the <hi>Jews</hi> were blam'd for not diſcerning <hi>The ſigns of the Times,</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.3.)

            <p>Who did not Apply the Waters failing from the <hi>Thames</hi> in K. <hi>J.</hi>'s time, ſo that Men went over on Foot to <hi>Southwark,</hi> to

            <p>To be <hi>Timorous</hi> at every thing that happens is <hi>Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is <hi>Stupidity,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> to become Inſenſible of what God is a ſhewing upon the Earth; and not to Regard the Operations of His Hands. It is and always has been, the forerunner of Deſtruction. <hi>Quos perdere vule Jupiter — Zach.</hi> (14.5.)

            </p>
            <p>And if the <hi>Vindication of the Deprived Biſhops,</hi> lately Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, be Truth, our <hi>Preſumption</hi> will exceed that of <hi>

            <p>This the <hi>Jacobites</hi> fore-told would be the Return the <hi>New Swearing</hi> Biſhops and Clergy would make, tho' they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That they deſired nothing more, than to Diſpute the Matter fairly in Print, to the ſatisfaction of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>The Conſequence of this, is more viſible than that of the <hi>Earth-quake;</hi> for every Body does already make the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

            <p>If this ſhould turn the Nation againſt them, and their Cauſe; that alone would have Conſequences, as to <hi>England,</hi> worthy to be fore-told by an <hi>Earth-quake:</hi> But as to other Countrys where this <hi>Earth-quake</hi> has been, let them Apply for themſelves. We have already heard of it from <hi>Paris, Holland, Cologne,</hi> and the <hi>Confederate</hi> Camp in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where our <hi>News</hi> tells us, it happened the very ſame Minute as in <hi>London;</hi> and was like to have ſhook the Houſe down o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver King <hi>William</hi>'s Head, and Chafed him from his Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as our <hi>Gazzet</hi> gives the Account. At the ſame
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65103:13"/> time our publick News, and private Letters tell us of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Storm and Tempeſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion the 7th. 8th. and 9th. of <hi>September</hi> (the Day of our <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> and the Day before, and the Day after) with a Violence not known in this Age, the Drops of Rain being obſerv'd to be as big as Hazel Nuts; and ſwel'd the Rivers to that degree, that ſeveral Ships were carry'd to the Sea, and loſt, and the men periſhed: Stacks of Corn were ſwept off the Land; Houſes, and their Inhabitants Drown'd, the Bridge of <hi>Lieth</hi> damaged, and many other Miſchiefs done.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, they make no <hi>Compariſons</hi> nor <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> yet cannot but take Notice of Things ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual, when they happen.</p>
            <p>But above all, of that <hi>Extraordinary Mark</hi> which GOD ſent with our <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> which was a ſtrange ſudden <hi>ſwimming in the Brain,</hi> and unaccountable <hi>Giddineſs,</hi> that ſome thought themſelves Seiz'd with a <hi>Fit</hi> of <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> others of the <hi>Palſy,</hi> ſome Stagger'd in the Streets, and were ſick Head and Stomack, like <hi>Sea-ſickneſs.</hi> I felt this Effect of it very ſenſibly, but did not own it till I heard it Generally Complain'd of all over <hi>London,</hi> and it ſtay'd with ſome <hi>Twenty-Four,</hi> with others <hi>Forty-Eight</hi> hours, after the <hi>Earth-Quake</hi> was over.</p>
            <p>I am told, That the ſmall <hi>Earth-Quake,</hi> which preceded the Great one at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> had the ſame Effect upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants there.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> will ſay, That it is a ſign of <hi>Infatuation,</hi> that our Brains are turn'd to run head-long (<hi>Impatient,</hi> or <hi>Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of <hi>Conviction</hi>) to our own Deſtruction: For they ſay, they can meet with few or none of us, who can give any Rational hopes of our Succeſs againſt <hi>France,</hi> but confeſs that ſomething <hi>Deſperate</hi> muſt be attempted. And what can it be, ſay they, but <hi>Infatuation,</hi> to Oppoſe all the Laws of God and Man, and to Refuſe an Honourable and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious PEACE, to Play out a deſperate Game? Unleſs we truſt to the Religiouſneſs of our Lives, to have Intereſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with Heaven, to work a <hi>Miracle</hi> for us, to Diſable the <hi>French</hi> all on a ſudden. For it muſt be ſuddenly, or it may come too late.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:65103:14"/>
            <p>And the <hi>Jacobites</hi> plead for themſelves, That they ought not to be eſteem'd as <hi>Enemies</hi> to the Nation, becauſe they are unwilling to Truſt the Fate of <hi>England</hi> upon ſuch a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Foundation, as our own <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> or the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of the <hi>French:</hi> Which Hopes we muſt expect to fail us, at ſome time or other, if we believe there is a God in Heaven, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we can Defend the <hi>Juſtice,</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> of our Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And therefore the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do provoke us upon this point.</p>
            <p>And I muſt confeſs, that without ſaying ſomething to this point, we do not Anſwer them.</p>
            <p>Which is the reaſon has moved me to Write all this, That I may perſwade the Learned Author of the <hi>Letter to a Friend,</hi> to afford us another Edition of that Ingenious Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and to give Satisfaction to theſe Demands of the <hi>Jacobites;</hi> ſome of whom, we are bound in Charity to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, are Honeſt, and Well-meaning Men, and therefore do deſerve thus much at our hands.</p>
            <p>If we will not vouchſafe them an Anſwer to this, we leave them Ground to ſay, That we ſhift the Queſtion, and ſeek to put them off with <hi>Politicks,</hi> when they require Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a Matter of <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' even in <hi>Politicks,</hi> they think, That the weightieſt Conſiderations, for the Good of the Nation, are thoſe which they offer. But they do not lay the Streſs upon this; That which they inſiſt upon is the <hi>Law of God,</hi> the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> and <hi>Natural Juſtice;</hi> againſt which, they ſay, our poor Fallible <hi>Politiques</hi> ought not to Prevail.</p>
            <p>This is what the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay in the General; and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it is a ſufficient Anſwer to all the Arguments in the ſaid Letter.</p>
            <p>But for greater Plaineſs, let us Apply what they have ſaid to the Arguments in the Letter, in the ſame Words, in which they are ſet down in the Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 24. of the Letter, The Queſtion is Reſolv'd as to <hi>Conſcience;</hi> and his Reaſons he puts by way of Queſtions, to the <hi>Proteſtant Non-Swearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Firſt Queſtion is, <q rend="inline">Whether they can think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65103:14"/> bound in Conſcience to Fight for <hi>Popery</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtant Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> that is, to Fight for <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> againſt the <hi>True Faith and Worſhip of Chriſt,</hi> or to Fight for <hi>Anti-chriſt,</hi> and againſt <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Can any Conſideration make this Lawful?</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Anſwer, That no Conſideration can make it Lawful.</p>
            <p>But then they ſay, That if the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Principles</hi> do Condemn the <hi>Depoſing Doctrine,</hi> they Fight againſt both, who Fight for the <hi>Depoſing Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this the <hi>Letter to a Friend</hi> does Confeſs in plain Terms, in the ſame place, <hi>viz. That we muſt not Fight againſt our Prince for Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt, in ſuch Caſes, requires His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to Suffer, and not to Fight for Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Jacobites</hi> are ſtill ready to maintain, that the Doctrine of <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> and <hi>Depoſing Kings,</hi> are Contrary to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principles.</p>
            <p>And that to Practiſe <hi>Popery</hi> (viz. <hi>The Depoſing Doctrine, Diſpenſing with Oaths,</hi> &amp;c.) will be a means to Introduce, not to Extirpate <hi>Popery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, without ſpeaking to this Point, all the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations</hi> this Author can make, are to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>They ſay the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who fought for Queen <hi>Mary</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> fought <hi>For the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery,</hi> tho' they fought to ſet up a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Queen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Queen, who was in <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they ſay that <hi>Theudas</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 5.) fought <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, tho' they fought <hi>to ſet it up,</hi> and to <hi>pull down</hi> the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all this, becauſe the <hi>Principles</hi> of a Religion are more to be Regarded, are more the <hi>Religion</hi> than its <hi>Legal Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next <hi>Queſtion</hi> this Author asks theſe <hi>Jacobites,</hi> is, (<hi>Page</hi> 25.) <hi>Do they think themſelves bound in Cenſcience to Fight for their Prince, againſt the Laws and Liberties of their Country?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Anſwer, That the <hi>Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> are expreſly <hi>On their ſide,</hi> againſt <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> of their <hi>King,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65103:15"/> or altering the <hi>Hereditary Monarchy,</hi> upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>And they ſay, That we do as good as Confeſs all this, when we will not ſtick by the Rule of <hi>the Law</hi> in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, but fly to <hi>Original Contract</hi> to over-Rule <hi>the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He asks, <hi>Have the reſt of mankind no Rights, but only Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Is there no ſuch thing as Juſtice due to our ſelves, nor to our fellow Subjects?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They Anſwer, The Greateſt <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> of <hi>Subjects,</hi> is to Preſerve the <hi>Laws,</hi> and chiefly the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> which is the Greateſt Barrier 'twixt <hi>Property,</hi> and the <hi>Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of their <hi>Fellow Subjects,</hi> which in <hi>Civil-War</hi> are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more Deſtructive to <hi>Property,</hi> than any <hi>Tyranny</hi> in the <hi>Soveraign.</hi> And therefore, that the Greateſt Juſtice we can do to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> or to <hi>our fellow ſubjects,</hi> is to beat down all theſe <hi>Popular</hi> pretences to <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſayes, <hi>A Nation which Fights againſt its own Laws and Liberties, is</hi> Felo de ſe.</p>
            <p>Witneſs <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> where, in <hi>three</hi> years, one half of the Nation have been Deſtroy'd upon this <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Pretence:</hi> Many more than a <hi>hundred Neroes</hi> ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would have put to Death.</p>
            <p>What will be the Fate of <hi>England</hi> in this Revolution, none yet can tell, but the <hi>Jacobites</hi> fear the worſt.</p>
            <p>They ſay that <hi>England,</hi> in this Quarrel, Fights againſt its own Laws, and therefore is <hi>Felo de ſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Can any Engliſh-man</hi> (ſayes this Author) <hi>whatever Opinion he has of the late K.</hi> James's <hi>Right, think himſelf bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to maintain his Right?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> think this a very ſtrange Queſtion.</p>
            <p>But the Author Adds, <hi>By giving up his Country to</hi> France, <hi>to make him King, and all his Subjects</hi> French <hi>Slaves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the Thing be Right, and according to God's Laws, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> deſire this Author to Anſwer it, whether he would not do it, whatever Nation in the World were concerned in it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They ſay, That Recalling K. <hi>James,</hi> is the only probable way to prevent our being <hi>French Slaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65103:15"/>
            <p>The Victories of <hi>France</hi> run in a full Tide againſt us, while, they ſay, our ſmall Succeſſes are brought to paſs by great Chances, even by <hi>Miracles,</hi> and ſeem to no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, than to keep us in heart, to give all the Money in the Nation to Forreigners, and continue Obſtinate till it be paſt Remedy.</p>
            <p>We Play (ſays the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) like a Gamſter, who Stakes his whole Stock every caſt of the Die; one Unluckey throw breaks him: and it is a Miracle if that throw do not come, if the Play continue long.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, he that Plays againſt us Manages his Stock, he lays up before-hand, and has already in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury the whole Expence for the Year 93. he Drains his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Degrees: We Squeze our <hi>Orange</hi> all at once: He Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages by Rules, and leaves nothing to Chance; we leave all to Hazard, ſee what will come on't: He lives upon his Intereſt, we ſpend off the Principal from Hand to Mouth, and our Money is ſpent before it comes in, great part of which goes to pay the Extraordinary Intereſt, upon which we Anticipate our Revenue: So that (if we truſt not to the Dice) we have certainly the worſt of the Lay; and nothing can ſave us but a ſudden ending of the Game, which we muſt loſe, if Management does Determin it, while the Enemy has the greater Stock.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe <hi>France</hi> ſhould Conquer us in this Quarrel (for nothing is impoſſible) whether (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) would we be in the blame, who perſwade to accept of the Peace which <hi>France</hi> preſſes upon us, upon no other Conditions than to Receive our King again? (which they ſay we are bound in Conſcience to do) or will not all the Miſchievous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch a Conqueſt ly at their Door who Reject this offered Peace, rather than Return to their Duty, or own that they have done amiſs?</p>
            <p>If we anſwer that we have not done amiſs. The <hi>Jacobites</hi> deſire no better than to bring it to that Teſt, to diſpute the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the Cauſe, without Conſideration of <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And even in Politiques, they ask us, whether they Judge wiſely, who are for continuing a War, wherein we muſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65103:16"/> truſt to Miracles for our Succeſs? and that too when we Fight againſt what moſt of us do acknowledge to be King <hi>James</hi>'s Right? or elſe he could have no Right to ſeek for it again, which he has by Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s own Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>But ſays our Author <hi>p.</hi> 25/26. <hi>Can any Prince have more Right to be King of</hi> England, <hi>than the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>has to be</hi> England?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> deſire this may be further explained. It is a fine round ſaying, and no doubt muſt be true; But they ſee not how we can apply it to the preſent Caſe.</p>
            <p>They ſay that <hi>England</hi> is moſt <hi>England</hi> when its Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>Monarchical</hi> and <hi>Hereditary,</hi> when its <hi>Monarch</hi> is Irreſiſtable <hi>by Force,</hi> even in Caſe of <hi>Male administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or <hi>upon any pretence whatſoever;</hi> for then the Door is for ever ſhut againſt all <hi>popular pretences</hi> for <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which our wiſe <hi>Legiſlators</hi> have found by experience to be infinitly of more dangerous Conſequence to <hi>England</hi> (as to all other Governments) than the <hi>Arbitrarineſs</hi> of the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours:</hi> and therefore have made <hi>Non-Reſistance</hi> an <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> It is our <hi>Law</hi> ſay they, the Law of <hi>England,</hi> it is our <hi>Conſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore that <hi>England</hi> is leaſt <hi>England</hi> when you break in upon her <hi>Constitution,</hi> over-turn her <hi>Laws,</hi> and, (being wiſer than your Fore-Fathers) open the Door to Eternal pretences for <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Reſtleſs Revolutions:</hi> They ſay that we are trying the experiment over again of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Oliver,</hi> and that <hi>England</hi> was then leaſt <hi>England:</hi> and ſo they ſay it is now; and that we may ſee it plainly by its Tottering, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, Aguiſh Diſpoſition, in danger to be Swallowed by <hi>France,</hi> if we will deſperately ſtand that Teſt) to be drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Confederates</hi> (which they ſay is in a pretty good forwardneſs) or to be divided at home, and make <hi>England</hi> the ſeat of the War, and ſhare the Fate of <hi>Ireland;</hi> which is moſt of all to be dreaded.</p>
            <p>All this, ſay theſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> is owning to our <hi>Revolution,</hi> and cannot be Remedy'd but by Returning our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> to their old Channel.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65103:16"/>
            <p>But, <hi>is it not an unaccountable tenderneſs and ſcrupuloſity of Conſcience</hi> (ſays our Author <hi>p.</hi> 26.) <hi>to be ſo concerned for any one Prince's Right, as to Sacrifice the Rights and Libertyes of all the Princes of</hi> Europe <hi>to his?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Queſtion the <hi>Jacobites</hi> anſwer, That they will Sacrifice no Mans Right to anothers: But if one Man will Invade anothers Right (as they pretend the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> did to K <hi>J.</hi>) and if a <hi>Confederacy</hi> of the Neighbourhood ſhould, for their own Ends, ſupport the Man who did the Wrong, they ſay that all Honeſt Men are bound in Conſcience to Act againſt that <hi>Confederacy:</hi> And if this ſhould turn to the Loſs of any of the <hi>Confederates,</hi> the Guilt lyes at their own Door.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> wonder we ſhould bring ſo plain a Caſe as this. And they ſay, that ſtanding by the Oppreſſed in ſuch a Caſe as this, is aſſerting the Rights and Liberties of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi> And that taking part with the Invaders of other Mens Right, is Sacrificing the Rights and Liberties, not only of all the the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> but of every <hi>Man</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Author Supports his Poſition, in theſe following words, <hi>It is to no more purpoſe to Diſpute with men who do not feel the Force of this Argument at the first hearing, than to Reaſon with Blind-men about Colours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Jacobites</hi> think this may be ſaid as to their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which are founded upon the Natural, and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Notions of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong;</hi> againſt which, if any Man Diſpute, he is ſuppos'd to have Denied, Firſt Principles, and ſo to be heard no longer. They ſay, That all their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are for Supporting <hi>Right;</hi> and that Ours are for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending <hi>Wrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I ſee no Remedy, but that we muſt come to the <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Wrong</hi> of the Cauſe with them; and muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelves to be Determined by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and by the Laws of the Land, as Eſtabliſhed in former <hi>Parliaments.</hi> If we Refuſe this Teſt, we ſhall have the Cry of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt us, for as yet they are not quite wrought off their Good Opinion of <hi>Scripture, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What follows in our Author upon this Argument, is (ſay
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65103:17"/> the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) an Effeminate breaking out into paſſion, when Reaſon ſails, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">They have no Senſe left, nothing but a <hi>Stupid</hi> and <hi>Slaviſh</hi> Loyalty — their ſenſeleſs miſtake of the true meaning of this word <hi>Loyalty;</hi> by which they will needs underſtand an abſolute Obedience without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation or Reſerve; when <hi>moſt certainly,</hi> it ſignifies no more than Obedience according to Law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus our Author, In return to which, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, they pitty his Paſſion, and paſs by his Complements, of <hi>ſtupid, ſlaviſh, ſenſeleſs</hi> — onely Admoniſh him for the future, that it is a certain ſign of a Loſt Cauſe, for while a Man thinks he has the better of the Diſpute, he is <hi>pleaſed:</hi> But he grows <hi>angry,</hi> only at an Argument which is too hard for him, he bites that as a ſtone that is thrown at him, becauſe it hurts him.</p>
            <p>But ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> we will not take that advantage of his paſſion, as to over-look any thing of his Argument. He ſayes, That <hi>moſt certainly,</hi> Loyalty ſignifies no more, than Obedience according to Law.</p>
            <p>Say the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> No more it needs, while the <hi>Law</hi> makes our Obedience <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and <hi>without Limitation,</hi> by Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it not to be Lawful <hi>upon any pretence whatſoever,</hi> to take Arms againſt the King, or thoſe Commiſſionated by him.</p>
            <p>And therefore the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do humbly mind this Author, that the <hi>ſenſeleſs</hi> miſtake he ſpeaks of, concerning the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word <hi>Loyalty,</hi> belongs to the <hi>Parliament</hi> (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he meant it) as well as to the <hi>Jacobites:</hi> For ſeveral Acts of Parliament do Enact <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and if that be not an <hi>Abſolute</hi> Obedience <hi>without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,</hi> then this Author, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> does wrong us, for we never carried <hi>Abſolute</hi> Obedience farther than <hi>Non-Reſistance,</hi> where, with a ſafe Conſcience, we cannot yield an Active Obedience: Allow us that, ſay they, and we will ſeek no more. But if you will not, then Rail at our <hi>Parliaments</hi> and our <hi>Laws,</hi> ſay they, call them <hi>ſenſeleſs, ſlaviſh,</hi> and what you will, but excuſe the poor <hi>Jacobites</hi> for following of theſe, till they be Repealed.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Anſwer, That Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> the Great Oracle of our Law, tells us, in <hi>Calvins</hi> Caſe, That
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65103:17"/> 
               <hi>Allegiance</hi> is prior to all <hi>Municipal Laws:</hi> That the World was long without <hi>Municipal Laws:</hi> And yet <hi>Allegiance</hi> was then Due from <hi>Subjects</hi> to their <hi>Soveraign.</hi> And this he calls <hi>Natural</hi> Allegiance, becauſe it ariſes not from the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any <hi>Municipal Law,</hi> but from the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> from that <hi>Natural Relation</hi> there is 'twixt the <hi>Governours</hi> and the <hi>Governed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this Allegiance comes to be <hi>Recogniz'd</hi> in the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal Laws</hi> of any Country, it is then called a <hi>Legal</hi> Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, not that it was Created by the <hi>Law</hi> (for it was prior to the Law, as has been ſaid) or that it receives more ſtrength by the <hi>Law;</hi> but it is Publiſhed, Aſcertained, and Recogniz'd by the Law, which alters nothing of its Force and Obligation, which it had <hi>before the Law.</hi> And hence the <hi>Natural,</hi> and the <hi>Legal</hi> Allegiance, are not <hi>two</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiances, but the ſame Allegiance Conſidered under different Modifications. As the King is the ſame King before and after his being Crown'd, or Recogniz'd by Parliament.</p>
            <p>Therefore Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> tells us, The <hi>Law</hi> did allow the Allegiance of the Subjects in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to be the ſame after King <hi>James</hi> the 1ſt. came into <hi>England,</hi> tho' the <hi>Municipal Laws</hi> of both Kingdoms did diſſer in many things.</p>
            <p>So that our Author's <hi>Moſt certainty</hi> (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) that <hi>Loyalty</hi> or <hi>Allegiance</hi> ſignifies no more than Obedience <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law,</hi> is <hi>moſt certainly</hi> otherwiſe, for tho' our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance be <hi>according to Law,</hi> becauſe it is Acknowledged and Recognized <hi>by the Law,</hi> yet it is prior to the Law, and therefore takes not all its Force from the Law; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſignifies ſomthing more than Obedience <hi>according to Law,</hi> viz. That Obedience which was before the Law, and which the Law it ſelf owns to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all the Arguments, every one in this Author, concerning the Reſolution of our Conſcience as to this Revolution.</p>
            <p>The remaining part of this Letter from <hi>p.</hi> 26/27. is only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the carriage of the preſent <hi>Jacobites</hi> while K. <hi>James</hi> was upon the Throne: which is not Material to our preſent buſineſs, for if they fail'd in any thing then,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65103:18"/> that is nothing as to the Guilding of our Conſcience now, this is nothing but perſonal Reflection, and is below Men of Argument that ſearch after Truth. This Author there takes a great deal of pains to Convince the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> that they ought to have Fought better than they did againſt the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> when he came over to Diſpoſſeſs his Father.</p>
            <p>This the <hi>Jacobites</hi> will readily Grant, and what will this Author gain by it?</p>
            <p>But he makes an excuſe for them. <hi>p.</hi> 28. <hi>They did not expect</hi> (ſays he) <hi>what followed; they deſired to have their Laws and Liberties ſecured, but not that the (King</hi> James) <hi>ſhould looſe his Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this the Author makes anſwer in theſe Words, <hi>But ſince he would leave his Crown, who could help it? For no body took it from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay they are aſtoniſhed at this. That they could not have expected this from ſo Celebrated a Pen as that of this Author.</p>
            <p>They ask whether this Author, or any Man in <hi>England</hi> thinks that K. <hi>James</hi> left his Crown Voluntarily?</p>
            <p>And whether Frighting a King out of his Kingdom he not a taking it from him?</p>
            <p>And then to cry as this Author here, <hi>who could help it? For no body took it from him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, they ſuſpect this Author to be turning towards <hi>Tranſ-ſub-stantiation,</hi> (he can never be too old to Learn) for if he can perſwade us out of our Senſes in one caſe, he may in another.</p>
            <p>Now (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) to ſee K. <hi>James</hi> Invaded by the P. of <hi>Orange,</hi> and made a <hi>Priſoner</hi> by him, removing his <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and clapping <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards upon him, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him out of his Bed and Pallace at two a Clock in the Morning, and after, Poſſeſſing his Crown, and then to ſay, <hi>that no body took it from him,</hi> is the ſame as to ſay that no body now poſſeſſes it. It is to bid us believe nothing we ſee, hear, or Feel.</p>
            <p>And is this the Foundation, ſay they, upon which you would ſettle our Conſcience, and hazard our Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65103:18"/>
            <p>If any body took K. <hi>James</hi>'s Crown from him, then (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) will you allow us to be in the Right, and your ſelves to be in the Wrong? You muſt do ſo, if you lay any ſtreſs upon this Argument.</p>
            <p>But if no body took it from him, then perhaps he has it ſtill, and we have him ſtill at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> it is only a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coptio Viſus;</hi> and we have been but Dreaming of Battles in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Flanders; Ireland</hi> is not Deſtroyed, nor have any Men Periſhed there!</p>
            <p>And now come <hi>Popery,</hi> we are ready for you, we will never Plead our ſenſes againſt you any more.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Jacobites</hi> inſult. And I confeſs it is the point I can leaſt anſwer; for, as they ſay, either K. <hi>James</hi> did Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily Relinguiſh his Crown (which no body in the World believes) or he was Frightned from it, and choſe rather to Loſe it for ſome time, and take his, hazard of Recovering it again, rather than ly at his Enemies Mercy to take that away, and his Life together whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> ever he Pleaſed (which no doubt was the Caſe) and I have heard many blame the ill Conduct of ſuffering him to Eſcape; and Create us ſo many troubles: Would any think him Safe, if he were in our hands now? Therefore it is a Demonſtration that it was his ſafeſt Courſe to Eſcape when he could.</p>
            <p>Our Author has a witty Sarcaſme upon this (<hi>p.</hi> 2.) <hi>King</hi> William (ſays he) <hi>wont Abdicate nor Steal away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> Laugh at this, and ask our Author, whether he would not Adviſe <hi>K. W.</hi> to make his Eſcape, if he were in the Circumſtances, in which K. <hi>J.</hi> was then? Suppoſe K. <hi>J.</hi> ſhould Invade, and Conquer K. <hi>W.</hi> Suppoſe the <hi>Engiſh</hi> ſhould Deſert K. <hi>W.</hi> as they did K. <hi>J.</hi> and that K. <hi>J.</hi> had made K. <hi>W.</hi> a Priſoner, and put him under <hi>French</hi> Guards, would not our Author, or any Friend of his, perſwade him to <hi>Abdicate</hi> and <hi>Steal Away,</hi> if he could?</p>
            <p>This the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, was poor and impotent in this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to ſtrain himſelf for a Reſlection upon K. <hi>J.</hi> to renen a Blow at him, and then to have no more to ſay againſt him. But to return to our Argument. The <hi>Jacobites</hi> do further inſiſt in behalf of K. <hi>J.</hi> That ſuppoſe his Fears were too Great, yet it was to Save his Life that he fled. And
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65103:19"/> will any ſay that this was no <hi>Force</hi> upon him? And ſhall our Author ask, <hi>Since he would go</hi> — as if it were <hi>Obſtiuacy,</hi> not <hi>Fear</hi> that preſt him? and, <hi>who could help it?</hi> as if it were againſt our will that he went, and that we were able and willing to protect him.</p>
            <p>And when he is thus <hi>Frightned away,</hi> and Forced to leave his Crown behind him to Save his Life, and then we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow this Crown upon another, and to Declare him to have no more Right to it, to ſay this is not a <hi>Taking it from him,</hi> the <hi>Jacobites</hi> alleadge is <hi>Non-ſenſe,</hi> even to the Degree of <hi>Madneſs.</hi> And the Caſe being thus ſtated, they muſt needs Gain all man-kind to their ſide; Men may <hi>pretend</hi> what they will, but it is not in a Mans power to <hi>Believe</hi> as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>And therefore, Sir, I do earneſtly intreat you to think of ſome Topick or other, to Anſwer theſe <hi>Jacobites,</hi> otherwiſe the Conſequence muſt be Fatal to the Government, to let them have all the plauſibility on their ſide.</p>
            <p>Whether you will pitch upon the way of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to <hi>Fore-Fault</hi> the King; and plainly own, as they do, his <hi>Forfeiting</hi> his Crown for <hi>Male-Adminiſtration,</hi> and therefore that they took it from him, by their Superior and Original Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Depos'd him Juſtly: Which I think a much eaſier way than ours. Or whether you will ſet up <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> or what other Method to ſatisfy Mens Conſciences, I ſubmit to your better Judgment: But ſomething muſt be done other than to ſay, that <hi>No body took K.</hi> J.'s <hi>Crown from him,</hi> for ſuch a <hi>Paradox</hi> can never paſs upon any Man of Honeſty or Common Senſe.</p>
            <p>And in your Managing this Cauſe, I ſhall deſire likewiſe, for the Honour of the Government, That you would avoid giving the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſuch a handle to Retort upon us as you do <hi>p.</hi> 28/29. where you inſiſt upon the <hi>Perjury, Mocking of God,</hi> and <hi>Deceiving the Government,</hi> in thoſe who have taken the <hi>New Oath</hi> to K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi> and yet ſhould Act againſt them.</p>
            <p>Here you could not but Imagin, That the <hi>Jacobites</hi> would Retort upon us, the Breach of our Oaths to K. <hi>J.</hi> And for us to Preach up the Obligation of Oaths in one Caſe, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65103:19"/> Cry them down in another, is expoſing our ſelves to the utmoſt Contempt; unleſs you had ſhewn ſome Difference 'twixt theſe Oaths, which you have forgot.</p>
            <p>As they did (the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay) who had the Penning of the Late <hi>Proclamation,</hi> 13. <hi>Sept.</hi> 92. againſt <hi>High-way-mer,</hi> and <hi>Robbers;</hi> and yet ſhew'd us not the Difference 'twixt Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing or Stealing <hi>Pence,</hi> and a <hi>Crown,</hi> why the Leſſer Stealth ſhould be Criminal; and the Greater Glorious: as if Kings onely, of all Mankind, were Diveſted of having any Right or Property; If they have, then forceing their Right from them is Robbery: And the <hi>Laws</hi> do ſecure the Right of the King beyond that of the Subject: Making a Treſpaſs, a <hi>Scandal,</hi> or an <hi>Aſſault</hi> againſt a <hi>Subject, Treaſon</hi> againſt the <hi>King.</hi> And yet this Proclamation begins, <hi>Whereas in Contempt of the Laws and well Eſtabliſh'd Government of this Kingdom, many Robberys have been of late Committed</hi> — as if (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) Robbing the King of his Crown were not a greater Contempt of the Laws, than Robbing a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man of his Purſe? Unleſs <hi>Princes</hi> be Exempt from the Eight Commandment, either in an <hi>Active</hi> or a Paſſive Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That they can neither <hi>Rob,</hi> nor <hi>be Robbed.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all they get is their own, and what others get from them is all well gotten. Theſe are Excellent Principles, and the onely Foundation of our Government, as the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do object. And therefore we ſhould do well to keep off theſe tender Points, and not give theſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> occaſion againſt us.</p>
            <p>You upbraid the Papiſts. <hi>p.</hi> 4. for <hi>knowing how to expound Providence to flatter Superstition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And you know how the <hi>Jacobites</hi> upbraid us with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding <hi>Providence</hi> to flatter <hi>Succeſs,</hi> tho' it were in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, Treachery, and all Wickedneſs, Which if it Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, it Immediately Commences not only <hi>Right</hi> but <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> as if Commanded by an <hi>Angel</hi> or a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or the Mouth of <hi>God Himſelf,</hi> according to Dr. <hi>Sherlock, &amp;c.</hi> What ſtrange Sermons (ſay theſe <hi>Jacobites</hi>) have we from your Biſhops and Top Divines, proving the Lawfulneſs of this Revolution from <hi>Providence,</hi> by which they mean <hi>Succeſs.</hi> Which was as much made uſe of, and almoſt in the ſame

            <p>
               <hi>God came from</hi> Nasby, <hi>and the Holy one from</hi> Marſton Moore! Selah!</p>
            <p>This will Juſtify the <hi>French</hi> King in all his Conqueſts, and gives <hi>Mahomet</hi> the better of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And yet (ſay the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi>) we are Deafned with it from your Pulpits.</p>
            <p>You might likewiſe have Forborn that little piece of Wit (<hi>p.</hi> 10.) of reckoning the <hi>Loud and Zealous Ladys</hi> of the <hi>Jacobire</hi> ſide: For you know where that is to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted <hi>at home!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the help of theſe <hi>Loud Ladys,</hi> you ſay, they (the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) are enough to make a Noiſe, but as they were not hands enough <hi>to hinder the late Revolution, neither can they</hi> (ſay you) <hi>make another.</hi> Here you make them very inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when you are upon your vapouring pin, as the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites</hi> do deride you: For they obſerve, that either your <hi>Memory</hi> or your <hi>Courage</hi> fails you, (<hi>p.</hi> 19.) where you make the number of the <hi>Jacobites</hi> the Great incouragement to the <hi>French</hi> King, to Reſtore King <hi>James:</hi> For, ſay you, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a hopeful Conſpiracy in</hi> England, <hi>the</hi> French <hi>King is too wary to make ſuch an Attempt.</hi> And (<hi>p.</hi> 21.) <hi>Were it not for them</hi> (our Factions at home) <hi>we need not fear its</hi> (France's) <hi>united Force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor are you leſs affraid of the Zealous Ladys you have provok'd, ſome of them may be upon your Top, but you Court them again (<hi>p.</hi> 21.) where reckoning the Miſeries of a Civil War, you Reckon the Loſs of <hi>Husbands,</hi> but not of <hi>Wives,</hi> this ſure will touch them in the ſenſible part, and Charm their tender Hearts!</p>
            <p>This was a great deal Tweeter, than what you have <hi>ſix</hi> Lines above, where, comforting us, as to the Taxes, and other Prices of this Revolution, you ſay, <hi>While we have left wherewithal to Maintain our ſelves, we have no ſuch great reaſon to complain.</hi> This might have been ſpared, becauſe you know we have leſt a great many <hi>Jacobites</hi> in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to Maintain themſelves.</p>
            <p>It had been alſo adviſible, if you had thought fit, to have let alone that Gentile Rub you gave King
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65103:20"/> 
               <hi>James</hi> (<hi>Page</hi> 20.) <hi>We know the Late King too well to take his word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this raiſes the Devil of an Objection, which the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites</hi> have againſt us, of our preſent King, not keeping to his <hi>Declaration,</hi> beſides many Breaches of Promiſes ſince, <hi>Diſpencing</hi> with the <hi>Law,</hi> and all thoſe Grievances, even Countenancing <hi>Popery,</hi> of which we Complain'd in K. <hi>J.</hi>'s time.</p>
            <p>In all whoſe Reign, we had no ſuch Example of Favour ſhewn to <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts and Friars, as was ſeen the Seſſions at <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> held 31. <hi>Aug.</hi> &amp; 1. &amp; 2. <hi>Sept.</hi> 92. Where <hi>two Friars,</hi> by name, <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Thursby,</hi> were Indicted for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a <hi>Coffee-Man</hi> in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> having firſt behauched his Wife in her Religion, and he was Jealous in her Chaſtity, as her ſelf confeſs'd in <hi>Court,</hi> where ſhe came, and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as an Evidence for <hi>Graham,</hi> who run her Husband thorow, but ſhe declared, That her Husband run himſelf upon his Sword.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Friars</hi> had the Intereſt (they ſay it was by means of the Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>) to have a Promiſe of their Pardon from K. <hi>W.</hi> then in <hi>Flanders.</hi> But it was thought the beſt way, to prevent the Noiſe that would make, to have them Acquit upon their Tryal; towards which all things being Diſpos'd, and the Neceſſary Orders given, the Conduct was committed to Judge — who had ſhewn himſelf ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous againſt the Deprived Biſhops, that he corrected the <hi>Cryer</hi> of his Court, for ſtileing one of them by the Title of <hi>Biſhop,</hi> when he call'd to have room made for him to come into the <hi>Court,</hi> whither he was Summon'd, as an Evidence in ſome <hi>Cauſe</hi> Depending: It is likely the <hi>Cryer</hi> had not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe made the people know whom he meant: But the <hi>Judge</hi> had better Skill in the Force of an <hi>Act of Parliament-Deprivation</hi> (which <hi>Hody</hi> himſelf, nor his <hi>Prompters</hi> behind the curtain, do pretend to take away the <hi>Character</hi>) that when he chid the <hi>Cryer</hi> for giving the Depriv'd Father the Title of <hi>Biſhop,</hi> What <hi>Biſhop?</hi> (ſayes <hi>Judge</hi>) come <hi>Doctor Lloyd,</hi> what have you to ſay —</p>
            <p>This Learned Judge altered his Countenance, and was all ſweetneſs to theſe <hi>Friars,</hi> which was obſerved by the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65103:21"/> whole <hi>Court;</hi> and when one Objected, that they were <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts,</hi> whom the Laws Diſcharged out of the Kingdom, upon pain of Treaſon: His Lordſhip temper'd that Man's Heat, with the Gravity and Calmneſs of a Judge, telling him, That was not the <hi>Cauſe</hi> before them — In ſhort. The <hi>Wife</hi> gave Evidence: The <hi>Judge</hi> Summ'd it up: The <hi>Jury</hi> Acquitted: And All the <hi>People</hi> took Notice.</p>
            <p>But it is not to be omitted, ſay theſe <hi>Jacobites,</hi> That in the <hi>Printed Account</hi> of the <hi>Trials</hi> that <hi>Seſſions,</hi> this of the <hi>Friars</hi> is left out: Which I have heard ſome ſay, was never done before, in any caſe, and durſt not have been done now, but by Order.</p>
            <p>But they ſay, what need we Inſtance Particulars? It is Notoriouſly known, That <hi>Popiſh Prieſts</hi> have of late not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own'd themſelves as ſuch before the Privy-Council, but pleaded it as an Argument for their Indemnity, and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Purſuant to the Secret Articles 'twixt King <hi>William,</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> King of <hi>Spain, &amp;c.</hi> And they have been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
            <p>It is true, we excuſe all this upon the account of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: But that does not ſtop the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Mouths. They ſay, that <hi>Neceſſity</hi> is as pleadable by one King as another. And beſides, That we have Created this <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> of which we Complain. And that if <hi>Papiſts</hi> muſt be Countenanc'd, what matter is it whether it be to Gratify the <hi>Confederates,</hi> or the <hi>French,</hi> who are leſs <hi>Papiſts</hi> than either <hi>Spain, Savoy,</hi> or the <hi>Popiſh Germans;</hi> and not more Perſecutors than any of theſe. All this the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do Retort upon us.</p>
            <p>Again, (<hi>p.</hi> 22.) abuſing of the <hi>French</hi> King, you ſay, <hi>He has no Scruple of Conſcience about the Rights of other Princes; all he can get is his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Sir, did not you Reflect that this is the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach which the <hi>Jacobiees</hi> caſt upon King <hi>William?</hi> with this aggravation, that he has no Scruple of Conſcience, not onely about the Rights of other Princes, but of his <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle:</hi> And if he can catch <hi>his Crown too,</hi> it ſhall be his own.</p>
            <p>And if he did this for Religion, why may not the <hi>French</hi> King do the ſame for his Religion, and ſee to get King

               <hi>William</hi>'s Crown if he can? Is the one more Impious than the other?</p>
            <p>King <hi>William</hi> gives it for one Reaſon of his War with <hi>France,</hi> to Reſtore the <hi>Hugonets,</hi> and other the <hi>French</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Rights by Law: To Re-ſettle their <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in their Ancient Authority, free from the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have been made upon them by their Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he has the ſame Grounds of War againſt <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden.</hi> Let them look to it!</p>
            <p>Now (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) if it be Lawful for Princes thus to look into one anothers Kingdoms; and take upon them to redreſs what they find amiſs in the Governments of other Nations; why do we blame the <hi>French</hi> King to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Re-ſettle King <hi>James</hi> having the Laws of <hi>England</hi> to plead on his ſide? Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> himſelf in his <hi>Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> allows King <hi>James</hi> to have ſtill the <hi>Legal Right;</hi> and upon that Ground, a Right to Regain the Crown if he can. Why ſhould the <hi>French</hi> King Rectifie the Incroachments of our <hi>Parliaments</hi> againſt our <hi>Kings;</hi> as well as we take upon us to Rectify <hi>his</hi> Incroachments againſt his <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall make a fine World of it when every Prince muſt Govern his Neighbours Country; or, as a Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor Words it, when one Prince muſt <hi>Interpoſe 'twixt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Prince and his Subjects, when he uſes them Cruelly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Loſs of all we have, and frequent Impriſonments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, without Information upon Oath, if double Taxes, and Twenty other ſuch Treatments be Cruel Uſages: Then by this Argument, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> or any other King, may interpoſe 'twixt K. <hi>William</hi> and his Subjects. And they appeal to you or any Man in the World, whether making the Refuſal of an Oath, which is againſt a Mans Conſcience to be a <hi>Premanire,</hi> as it is in <hi>Ireland,</hi> be not ſome Degrees worſe than any <hi>French Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooning</hi> as it is Painted to the Worſt? And then Impoſing this upon all <hi>Women</hi> as well as <hi>Men</hi> above eighteen Years of Age, may be Aggravated, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> upon theſe Principles, to Provoke all Kings and States, to Interpoſe 'twixt theſe Subjects and their <hi>Prince.</hi>

            <p>Good Sir; I beſeech you to Diſ-ingage the Government from theſe Intanglements, which its <hi>Convert Advocats,</hi> and <hi>Falſe Friends</hi> have brought upon it.</p>
            <p>But by none more than your ſelf, Sir, in this Letter to a Friend, p. 28/29. Where, ſpeaking of the Oath to K. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> you expound Faith and Allegiance to the loweſt Senſe that poſſibly can be ſuppoſed even by <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and you make it to exclude, under the Guilt of <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Perjury,</hi> any Attempt againſt their <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Crowns</hi> to whom we have Sworn, or <hi>to hold any Correſpondence with, or to give any Aſſiſtance to their Enemys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This you did to deter the Swearers to K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> from <hi>Countenancing the</hi> French <hi>Invaſion, or to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Late King in Recovering the Throne.</hi> But did you foreſee, Sir, That this Rule you ſet down will Involve all thoſe in <hi>Down-right Perjury,</hi> according to the very loweſt Senſe of Allegiance that can poſſibly be made, even by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamites,</hi> who held Correſpondence with the P. of <hi>Orange,</hi> or Aſſiſted him in this Revolution. Sir, you are one who Turn'd late: And to ſave your own Credit, and new Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, would make Perjur'd Miſcreants of all who came into this Revolution before your ſelf. Now the Fiſh is Caught, you come in for a Snack, but give all thoſe to the Devil, who provided Hooks or Nets.</p>
            <p>Sir, I am not now Perſonating the <hi>Jacobite,</hi> I ſpeak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in behalf of thoſe who had a Hand, and Glory in it, in bringing about this Wonderful Revolution. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think their Part to be wholly <hi>Diabolical,</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance and Effecting of that which muſt be all over <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> to you in the Enjoyment of their Labours, and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; You cry that K. <hi>James</hi> went no doubt as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined of him: But to them by whom he was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd! And yet you will take a Share in the Price for which he was Sold.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if it was ſuch a <hi>Damn'd</hi> Deſign in them to bring in the P. of <hi>Orange;</hi> his Highneſſes's Deſign could not be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Heavenly;</hi> But you are content to make a Rogue of him too, to ſave your own Bacon. Sir, this deſerves ſome Animadverſion from the Government; For all your skil
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65103:22"/> will never perſwade plain Honeſt <hi>Engliſh-Men,</hi> that it was <hi>Knavery</hi> and <hi>Down-right Perjury</hi> in all the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who Plac'd the P. of <hi>Orange</hi> upon the Throne: And yet when he is there by ſuch Wicked Act of theirs, that this can give him <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> and their own Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Act, Abſolve them from their former Lawful Oaths, and Oblige them in Conſcience to Maintain and Defend their ſaid Wicked Act, and to Swear never to Return from it. This all Men will call Swearing never to Repent. And to give ſuch an Account of our Revolution, by one who ſets up now for the Chief Advocate of it, is Betraying it, and Expoſing it more than all <hi>Jacobites,</hi> or Profeſt Enemys can ſay. It ſhews us to ſtand upon ſuch Ridiculous Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as muſt Nauſeat all who pretend to Common Senſe. And it Confirms the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Irrecoverably in what they think to be Loyalty; while they ſee us Defend our ſelves like Fools and Mad-Men, by Arguments which evidently Deſtroy our Cauſe.</p>
            <p>And, Sir, you needed not have done this, you might eaſily have avoided theſe ſort of Stumbling Blocks: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I adviſe you to avoid Excurſions, March on ſtraight your Road, Tread warily, ſay no more than you muſt.</p>
            <p>And do not go out of your way for the pleaſure of Laſhing the <hi>French</hi> King himſelf, for it does not alwaies turn to Advantage. p. 23. You purſue him to the <hi>Boyne,</hi> to <hi>Athlone,</hi> to <hi>Agrim,</hi> to <hi>Limrick,</hi> and ſay we <hi>Beat him</hi> in all theſe Places, <hi>and in a Word</hi> (ſay you) <hi>we Beat him out of</hi> Ireland: <hi>And have now got a Habit of Beating the</hi> French.</p>
            <p>This indeed, Sir, with all due Deference to your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is horribly Ridiculous: Or, you ſpeak without Book, and know not what you ſay, for it is moſt certain, that at <hi>Athlone,</hi> at <hi>Agrim,</hi> at <hi>Limrick,</hi> there were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Forty or Fifty <hi>French</hi> in the whole <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army: And there were more than Twenty times as many in K. <hi>William</hi>'s Army. Therefore to cry we have Beat <hi>him</hi> (the <hi>French King</hi>) that <hi>we have got a Habit of Beating the</hi> French!</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65103:23"/>
            <p>If you had a mind to have Beaten K. <hi>Lewis,</hi> you ſhould have ſought him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> not in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (where he never was) how very Comical, do you think, would this Paſſage of your Letter look to him if he ſaw it? Would he not deſire you to remember <hi>Namure,</hi> and <hi>Steenkirk,</hi> and ask you how you came to forget your <hi>Habit</hi> there?</p>
            <p>Do not Miſtake me, as if I did in the leaſt derogate from the Courage of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> No, They ſhew'd it at <hi>Steenkirk</hi> to admiration, and had they been Supported, might have done Maricles; ſurely no Men upon Earth would go farther under Good Conduct: They are too Good to be alwayes, and raſhly Expoſed and made the Subject of <hi>Dutch</hi> Railery, who have Painted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fighting in this Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with <hi>Lions Paws,</hi> and <hi>Calves Heads. i. e.</hi> under ſuch Commanders.</p>
            <p>But it is exceeding Childiſh, thus to Undervalue other Men, and Vapour of our Victories over the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> It hinders Men from laying weight upon any thing elſe that we ſay. And does no ſmall Service to the <hi>Jacobite</hi> Cauſe, while it is made ſo eaſie for them to Expoſe us.</p>
            <p>As they think it is likewiſe in a later Inſtance, <hi>viz. A True Account of the Horrid Conſpiracy against the Life of his Sacred Majeſty,</hi> William <hi>the Third,</hi> &amp;c. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by <hi>Authority,</hi> and Printed in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> 1692. Giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Account of the Tryal, Condemnation, and Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Chevalier de Grandval,</hi> in the Camp. 13. <hi>Aug.</hi> 92. For being concerned in the ſaid Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>There p. 7. K. <hi>J.</hi> and his Queen are made Partys in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, and to have Encourag'd thoſe Officers who were to do him <hi>that Service,</hi> as it is there Worded.</p>
            <p>And I have heard the Hawkers cry that Paper about the Streets, by the Name of The Horrible and Bloody Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy carryed on by the late K. <hi>James,</hi> and the late Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> to Murther his Sacred Majeſty K. <hi>William.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do highly Complain: and ſay, That the Sins of theſe Nations are yet increaſing, That inſtead of their Repentance, for the now known Notorious Slanders, which, in order to the preſent Revolution, were induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65103:23"/> ſpread abroad againſt King <hi>James,</hi> as that of the <hi>French League,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and that Maſs of Calumnies laid upon him in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince; They ſay that inſtead of Repenting for theſe, we are yet going on to load him with new Crimes, which the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> are confident they can prove as falſe as any of the other.</p>
            <p>They will never believe that King <hi>James</hi> would give his Conſent to <hi>de Witt</hi> or <hi>Glenco</hi> any Body: They ſay it is not in his Nature. Which all that know him well will allow.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, that it is not all the <hi>Williamites</hi> can make this any Objection againſt King <hi>James:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many of them, even Officers of the Army, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and do it openly, that they think it a good Act to Stab King <hi>James,</hi> as much, and more than any common Thief or Robber; becauſe, as they ſay, he does greater Hurt than they, and is the Occaſion of greater Blood-ſhed and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>I have heard ſeveral of them <hi>(when they were not drunk)</hi> ſay, That they would ſtab him with their own Hands, and go an Hundred Miles barefoot to have the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
            <p>But for King <hi>Lewis,</hi> They think it a meritorious Act to rid the World of ſuch a Monſter, to give Peace to <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and to revenge the Cauſe of the poor <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for theſe Men (how numerous ſoever) the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> ſay, they muſt be ſilent, and not blame King <hi>James</hi> if he had ſuch a Deſign, becauſe it is purſuant to their own Principles.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Jacobites</hi> lay no ſtreſs upon this, nor plead for <hi>Aſſaſſinations,</hi> which they deteſt; but they inſiſt againſt the Truth of the Matter of Fact, and that King <hi>James</hi> never had any ſuch Deſign, nor knew of this Conſpiracy of <hi>Grandval,</hi> if there was any ſuch Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, give me leave to tell you ſome of thoſe Grounds upon which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do not believe this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, at leaſt that part of it which concerns K. <hi>James,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:65103:24"/> and that even before they receive a full Account of it from St. <hi>Germains,</hi> which can be beſt done there; and when they receive it, they promiſe to communicate it for farther Satisfaction. In the mean time take what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, for the Reaſon of their preſent Infidelity in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is ſaid, p. 7. of the aboveſaid Account of this Conſpiracy, in the very Sentence of the Judges, That Collonel <hi>Parker</hi> (one of the Conſpirators) was with <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> and <hi>Leefdale,</hi> (two other of the Conſpirators,) to take leave of K. <hi>James</hi> at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> before they began their Journey, (<hi>viz.</hi> to K. <hi>William</hi>'s Camp, to perpetrate their intended Deſign, where <hi>Parker</hi> was to be a main Actour, and together with <hi>Grandval</hi> to reſcue and bring off <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> with Fifteen Hundred <hi>French</hi> Horſe, after he had ſhot K. <hi>William.</hi>) Now inſtead of <hi>Parker</hi>'s going as above deſigned to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and having taken leave of K. <hi>James</hi> with the other Conſpirators, in order to their ſaid Journey, it is notoriouſly known that <hi>Parker</hi> came ſtreight to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> think totally inconſiſtent with all that fine Story, and to give it flatly the Lye.</p>
            <p>But they reſt not upon this, they give a poſitive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to the Allegation, by ſhewing that Collonel <hi>Parker</hi> was not at St. <hi>Germains</hi> the <hi>Sixteenth</hi> day of <hi>April,</hi> 1692. on which day the Sentence of the Judges (p. 7.) ſays, that he <hi>(Parker)</hi> was there with King <hi>James,</hi> and in Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Grandval</hi> and <hi>Leefdale</hi> about the ſaid Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy: Which 16th of <hi>April,</hi> if it ſhould be New-ſtyle, will be the 6th Old-ſtyle, when <hi>Parker</hi> (the True Account ſays) was at St. <hi>Germains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For diſproof of this, they give you a Journal of Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Parker</hi>'s coming from St. <hi>Germains</hi> to <hi>England</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> 1692. which they have from Undeniable Vouchers, <hi>viz.</hi> Collonel <hi>Parker</hi> having taken his leave of King <hi>James</hi> at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> he went to <hi>Paris Sunday</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> of <hi>April</hi> (Old Style) 1692. on <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Fifth,</hi> all Day and Night, he was actually at <hi>Paris,</hi> on the <hi>Sixth,</hi> by Five a Clock in the Morning, at <hi>Paris</hi> he took Coach to Saint <hi>Dennis,</hi> and that Night he lay
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65103:24"/> at <hi>Boumont,</hi> the <hi>Seventh</hi> at <hi>Bovay,</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi> at <hi>Poy,</hi> the <hi>Ninth</hi> at <hi>Abevile,</hi> the <hi>Tenth</hi> he took Poſt to <hi>Callis,</hi> where he Embark'd for <hi>England;</hi> he was Shipwrackt on the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Shore, where ſoon after he was taken Priſoner, and carryed before the Mayor of <hi>Rumney,</hi> and on the <hi>Thirteenth</hi> he was ſent Priſoner to <hi>London</hi> with a Guard.</p>
            <p>His being at <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Fifth,</hi> and taking Coach from thence on the <hi>Sixth</hi> by Five in the Morning, can be prov'd by at leaſt <hi>Twenty</hi> Credible Witneſſes; and all along from thence to the <hi>Thirteenth</hi> by <hi>Three</hi> Undeniable Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>But all this, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, proves the Matter of the <hi>True Account</hi> to be <hi>only Falſe.</hi> They alledge other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in that Tryal which make it wholly <hi>Ludicrous,</hi> and utterly <hi>Incredible</hi> to any Man of Senſe.</p>
            <p>Such is that of <hi>Du-mont</hi> (the Man who was to kill King <hi>William</hi>) having <hi>a Secret to charm People's Eyes.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing leſs could ſecure a Man to kill a King at the Head of his Army, as this was to be done, <hi>viz. when the King ſhould ride along the Lines.</hi> The other two Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (<hi>Grandval</hi> and <hi>Leefdale,</hi>) it is ſaid were to <hi>keep with thoſe that followed the King; and when every Body was purſuing after</hi> Du-mont (who was Inviſible, having a Secret to charm People's Eyes,) <hi>they ſhould have time to eſcape and ſave themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Scheme and Manner of executing the ſaid Deſign which was contrived by the Marquiſs of <hi>Barbeſieux,</hi> Son to the Marquiſs of <hi>Louvois,</hi> as alſo Secretary of State to the <hi>French</hi> King, Mounſieur <hi>Paparell,</hi> and ſome of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the higheſt Employments, and of the greateſt Credit in the <hi>French</hi> Court, as the <hi>True Account</hi> ſays.</p>
            <p>If they could contrive no better than this, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> think we ſhould not find ſo much trouble in our War with <hi>Frarce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They deſire to be excuſed if it be not in their power to believe, that the Great Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> could concert their Buſineſs no better than this.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:65103:25"/>
            <p>Not to name ſeveral leſſer Matters, as that <hi>Du-mont</hi> was to ſhoot at King <hi>William,</hi> at an hundred paces diſtance, (he might have come nearer being <hi>Inviſible.</hi>) If King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> had been alone, there was hazard of miſſing, or not killing kim at that diſtance: But conſider him ſurrounded with his Officers and Attendants, and that his Stature is not ſo Great as to be hit over other People's Heads, at a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces diſtance, you muſt then ſhoot through two or three likely before the Bullet could come at him: But perhaps <hi>Du-Mont</hi> had an Inviſible way of taking aim too, and could charm his Bullet to follow his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>It was likewiſe pretty difficult which was contrived by the Marquiſs of <hi>Barbeſieux, Paparel, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 5, 6. <hi>viz.</hi> That after <hi>Du-Mont</hi> had ſhot King <hi>William</hi> at his Grand Guard, the Priſoner <hi>(Grandval)</hi> and <hi>Parker,</hi> (who was in <hi>England,</hi>) with fifteen hundred Horſe from the Grand Guard of the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s Army, were to reſcue <hi>Du-Mont,</hi> and bring him off; the ſaid <hi>Du-Mont</hi> giving timely notice to the Priſoner <hi>(Grandval)</hi> of the intended Execution. Thus the <hi>True Account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> think this almoſt as impracticable as the other Contrivance of the <hi>Charm.</hi> For <hi>Du Mont</hi> was to watch his Opportunity to ſhoot King <hi>William</hi> as he went to viſit the Grand Guard, and had no choice left (by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance) but to <hi>charm</hi> King <hi>William</hi> to ſtand ſtill, and in the ſame Poſture he lik'd, till he could give timely notice to the Priſoner of the intended Execution: Or if he had a <hi>Familiar</hi> to fly ſwiftly with the Errand; yet after he had ſhot King <hi>William,</hi> he would need another Secret to <hi>charm</hi> Peoples <hi>Hands</hi> from falling upon him, till his Friends ſhould come from the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi>'s Grand Guard to reſcue him.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>True Account</hi> ends with a Material Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">That it was like enough Monſieur <hi>Barbeſieux</hi> would diſown that he gave any ſuch Orders, or that he was any ways concerned in a Buſineſs of this Nature. <hi>To which</hi> Grandval <hi>reply'd,</hi> let him deny what he pleaſes, yet if I were put upon it; I would make it appear very
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65103:25"/> plain, for I have an Original Paper under Monſieur <hi>Barbeſieux</hi>'s own hand, which I have Lodg'd with a Friend of Mine, who will not part with it to any one but my ſelf, and no Body elſe knows with whom I have Intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</q> Thus ends <hi>The True Account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> reply, that either the Priſoner was then <hi>put upon it</hi> (ſince as the <hi>True Account</hi> tells us in the ſame place, that he ſought to Juſtify himſelf upon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he had received from the Marquis of <hi>Barbeſieux</hi>) or when, or how was it he could be <hi>put upon it,</hi> if not to Defend his Life? And when he thought that proving the Marquis <hi>Barbeſieux</hi> Orders to him would be a Juſtification of him, why would not he Produce the Orders? Was not he then <hi>put upon it?</hi> Would he give ſuch a Ridiculous Anſwer as to ſay he had left them with a Friend whom no Body knew, and who was Engag'd not to part with them to any but himſelf, after he had, without Torture, ſo frankly Confeſt all the reſt of the Conſpiracy? No. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

There muſt be ſome other meaning in it.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, they can think of nothing elſe, but that <hi>Grandval</hi> has been put upon to give this Evidence to Blacken K. <hi>James</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Court, with promiſe of Life <hi>in ultimo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thoſe were the Council. <hi>Ginckle</hi> (lately made Earl of <hi>Athlone</hi>) General <hi>Van Scravenmore,</hi> and Lieutenant General <hi>Talmaſh;</hi> the Marquis <hi>Da la Foreſt,</hi> the Heer <hi>Van Weede,</hi> Count <hi>Noijelles</hi> and the Heer <hi>Zabel</hi> Majors General, and the Brigadeers <hi>Churchill</hi> and <hi>Ramſey; Cornelius Van Wou,</hi> and <hi>Richard <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>thwayt,</hi> Judgas Advocates Aſſiſting, who have ſhewn as much <hi>Integrity</hi> as <hi>Ingenuity</hi> ſay the <hi>Jacobites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, Theſe are ſome of the Objections which I have heard the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Urge, to Invalidate this pretended Evidence of <hi>Grandval</hi> againſt K. <hi>James.</hi> And he came not off ſo well as the Sham Spy who was to be Hang'd at <hi>Notingham,</hi> when Princeſs <hi>Ann</hi> was there: But <hi>Grandval</hi> is taken out of the way to give farther Evidence; Therefore it will concern the Government that ſomething be ſaid to this, leaſt the Reflection which this Account of <hi>Grandval</hi> is thought to bring upon K. <hi>James,</hi> return double upon our ſelves. And tho' this has been Publiſhed ſince the Writing of your <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a Friend,</hi> yet I know of no better Hand to whom to Recommend ſo neceſſary a Vindications of our Proceedings in this Matter, and therefore I Intreat that you would Conſider it together with the other <hi>Jacobite</hi> Objections which I have offered to you in this Paper, to receive your Anſwer, for the Good of the Nation.</p>
            <p>And do not think that this is ſufficiently done by thoſe Papers that have been cry'd about the Streets, and Licens'd by the Government, telling us of ſeveral Apparitions to Private Souldiers in K. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> giving Account of this Deſign of Aſſaſſinating K. <hi>William,</hi> and God's Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Providence in Detecting; Preventing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This may paſs perhaps among ſome of the Vulgar, for whom I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it was Deſign'd; But it Nauſeats Men of Senſe exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. It looks like putting this ſtory upon us, and they wonder at ſuch poor Arts. It had been much eaſier believ'd if theſe <hi>Viſions,</hi> and <hi>Du Monts Charm</hi> had been let alone.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65103:26"/>
            <p>But, Sir, you cannot readily conceive the Horror and Aſtoniſhment which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do Expreſs at our carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this Sport (as they call it) ſo far as to Bantre All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God with it in the Proclamation for a Publick Thankſgiven, Dated. 22. <hi>Octob.</hi> 92. Where it is told that <hi>Forasmuch as it hath Pleaſed Almighty God of His Infinite Goodnoſs in Anſwer to the Prayers Humbly and Devoutly offer'd up to Him — To Diſappoint and Defeat the Barbarous and Horrid Conſpiracy for Taking away His</hi> (<hi>K.</hi> William's) <hi>Sacred Life by Aſſaſſination</hi> — And this Thankſgiving Day ordered to be <hi>Religiouſly</hi> kept with greater Strictneſs, and under greater Penaltys than is uſual in Proclamations of that Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Not only, <hi>as they Tender the Favour of Almighty God,</hi> but, <hi>upon Pain of Suffering ſuch Puniſhments as Their Majeſties can juſtly Inflict for the Contempt or Neglect thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And which is yet more Dreadful (if that Conſpiracy be a Sham) in the Publick Printed Forme of Prayer for the Thankſgiving-Day, in the End of the <hi>Litany,</hi> theſe Words are added — <hi>More eſpecially we adore Thy Great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Him (K.</hi> William) <hi>in the Diſcovery and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Bloody and Ba barous Attempt, Deſign'd upon His Sacred Perſon by His Cruel and Implacable Enemys</hi> — and in the Communion-Service, <hi>O Moſt Merciful God, who of thy Infinite Goodneſs hast Preſerved our Sovereign Lord King</hi> William <hi>from the Treacherous Practiſes of Wicked and Blood-Thirsty Men,</hi> &amp;c. — Add to this the Noiſe was made with it in <hi>Pulpits</hi> upon that Ringing-Day, the Repetition of the <hi>Tirue Account</hi> aboveſaid, being a great part of many of their Sermons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>J. Cant.</hi> himſelf had it up in his Thankſgiving-Sermon that Day at <hi>White-Hall.</hi> p. 25. Where he Bleſſes God <hi>For the Preſervation of our Gracious Sovereign, from that Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and moſt Barbarous Attempt Deſign'd upon his Sacred Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good God! What Name will this <hi>Pageantry</hi> deſerve, if this Blot be not clear'd from all the boveſaid Objections?</p>
            <p>Sir, This requires your utmoſt Pains, if you have any Kindneſs for the Government. This is indeed a Terrible
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65103:27"/> Prejudice againſt us, it makes us worſe than <hi>Hembent,</hi> or meer <hi>Atheists:</hi> For to Mock God is more Provoking (I had almoſt ſaid more <hi>Atheistical</hi>) than not to Believe a God at all.</p>
            <p>If this be let go, without ſomething ſaid to it, it will, as the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſaid of <hi>Judith,</hi> Deceive the whole World, Turn all Mankind againſt us, and make us the Abhorring of all Fleſh, who can Play with things Sacred, and Laugh at God to his Face!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> likewiſe take Great Notice, that we ſhould chooſe one of the <hi>Faſts</hi> of the Church (the Vigil before Saint <hi>Simon</hi> and Saint <hi>Jude</hi>) for our <hi>Thankſgiving-Day.</hi> As if we Deſign'd to do Deſpight to the Conſtiſtution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> like the Phanaticks in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who uſually Appoint their <hi>Faſts</hi> upon the <hi>Lords Day, Chriſtmas, Eaſter,</hi> or other Solemnitys of the Church. It was ſome of this <hi>Dutch</hi> Leven, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> that made us pitch upon <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday, viz.</hi> 13. of <hi>Feb.</hi> 88. For the Day of our Inauguration, and Acceſſion to the Crown. Either that we thought the greateſt <hi>Faſt</hi> of the Church, ought, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of that Conſtitution, to be turn'd thereafter into a <hi>Jubilee;</hi> or otherwiſe that the Day of <hi>Aſhes</hi> and <hi>Execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> was the fitteſt to Solemnize ſuch an Inauguration as claim'd a Propriety (ſay they) in almoſt every Curſe was pronounced that Day.</p>
            <p>The 27. <hi>Octob.</hi> is Mark'd in our <hi>Calander</hi> and <hi>Rubrick</hi> as a Day of Faſting or Abſtinence; and was, or ought to have been, Proclaim'd as ſuch in all the Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Sunday</hi> before, as is Appointed in the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> immediately after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Service.</p>
            <p>Now comes <hi>Jo. Cant.</hi> (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) and Litenſing the Form of Prayer for this Thankſgiving-Day, Commands us to break the Canons and Rubricks which are ſtill unrepeal'd by any Lawful or ſo much as Pretented Authority. And they ask, in good Conſcience, which we ought to Obey? They ſay, we may perceive by theſe, and many other things which they can Name, what Firm Friends our <hi>New Biſhops</hi> are like to prove to the <hi>Church of</hi> England,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65103:27"/> 
               <hi>as by Law Establiſhed,</hi> which us'd to be the Word. But we have ſeen ſtrange things to Day!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſcotia Fresbyter profugus</hi> — (ſays the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) a <hi>Scotch Dusckify'd Facovian Superintendent,</hi> to ſhew the Rock from whence he was Hewn, and not to be behind his Arch Brother <hi>Jack,</hi> in his Zeal againſt <hi>ſet-Forms,</hi> and Faſting his Foe, kept his Viſitation at <hi>Abington,</hi> on their own Dear Faſt-Day; whereby he Preſerv'd his Clergy, for that Turn, from Attending their Churches, and Officiating in the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary Superſtition, and ſhew'd them Good Example not to <hi>Starve</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> for Pampering of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give this Exceſs. But now we are upon <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have one thing more to beſeech you moſt earneſtly, which is, to Remove, if Poſſible, a Monſtrous Scandal which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> have taken at our Government in the Matter of the Laird of <hi>Glencoe,</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> who upon the 13. <hi>Feb.</hi> 91/92, at Five a Clock in the Morning, with <hi>Thirty Eight</hi> of his Servants and Tenants, were Barbarouſly Murdered in their Beds by Captain <hi>Campbel</hi> of <hi>Glen-Lyon,</hi> and his Souldiers of the Earl of <hi>Arguil</hi>'s Regiment, who were Quartered upon them, and Liv'd in Terms of Friendſhip with them: And they pretend that all this was done by K. <hi>William</hi>'s Expreſs Command, and Produce Orders for what they have done; and ſtand upon their Juſtification, and are to this Day Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſh'd for it.</p>
            <p>This Story is not much known in <hi>England,</hi> but it makes a Great Noiſe in <hi>Scotland.</hi> inſomuch that I am told, that Sir <hi>John Lawder</hi> there did Refuſe to accept of the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Lord Advocate</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> (which anſwers to that of <hi>Atturney General</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but of much greater Honour and Authority) unleſs he could have Liberty to Proſecute <hi>Glen-Lyon</hi> and the other Murthers of <hi>Glen-Coe.</hi> But that could not be Granted him; and another is put into the Place. This Story of <hi>Glen-Coe</hi> is told at Large in the Anſwer to Docter <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>State of the Protectants in</hi> Ireland, <hi>under the Late K.</hi> James's <hi>Government.</hi> To which I referr you.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, give me leave I beſeech you, do not you agree with me that there is an Abſolute Neceſſity to Search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65103:28"/> the bottom of this Myſtery? There is none can be ſo Wicked as to Imagin that any part of the Blame can ly at K. <hi>William</hi>'s Door; and therefore it is for his Honour to have it expos'd, and let thoſe be Examplarily Puniſh'd, who have Dar'd to Vouch <hi>Royal Authority</hi> for the moſt Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Maſſacre under the ſhew of Truſt and Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>It may be Suppoſed that K. <hi>William</hi> does not yet know of this, or is not at Leiſure from his Greater Buſineſs to Examine into it at this Juncture: But, Sir, it will well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit you, in the mean time, to think of ſomething to be ſaid to Qualify the Out-crys of the <hi>Jacobites</hi> upon this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>If any thing, they ſay, had appear'd under K. <hi>James</hi>'s Hand, tho' Counterfit, as the Tryal of <hi>Grandval,</hi> towards the Aſſaſſination of K. <hi>William,</hi> they would have thought themſelves Obliged to have Inquired, and Detected the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery; otherwiſe that they could not have ſufficiently Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his Honour. At leaſt K. <hi>James</hi> himſelf would have Diſown'd it, which if he Scrupl'd, or Neglected to do, after it came to his Ears, it would indeed be a Ground of Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that could not eaſily be Rubb'd off.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Sir, for the Kings Honour, for the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Nation, and the ſilencing theſe <hi>Jacobites,</hi> for the love of <hi>Truth</hi> take ſome Pains in theſe things: Your Circumſtances do enable you to Enquire more Effectually than other Men, and to know the Truth, in which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to let us all Participate; at leaſt ſo far, as that yours and others Silence herein, Confirm not the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and make others doubt, that all the Cry about <hi>Glen-Coe</hi> and other Matters, have not been without ſome Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Sir, The <hi>Jacobites</hi> Report upon us, That the <hi>Aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſinations</hi> and <hi>Shamm-Plots</hi> which we charge upon others, diſcover their Father by their Phizz, and comparing them with others of the ſame Production, they plainly tell who it was that Begat them. This Method, they ſay, has been ſome Body's Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ever ſince his appearing in the World: He began with the <hi>De-Witts,</hi> and brought about a Glorious Revolution there. He would make one almoſt in Love with <hi>Evil,</hi> to ſee how much <hi>Good</hi> it Produces!</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65103:28"/>
            <p>His Enemys, and who pretend to know him well, ſay, that his Nature is ſo incapable of Mercy, that his Revenge can never be ſatisfy'd with leſs than Blood. They tell how he Boaſted to K. <hi>J.</hi> himſelf, then Duke of <hi>York, Anno.</hi> 1679. That it had coſt him above 1200 Lives, by Execution in cold Blood, to bring his Army to that Diſcipline it was in.</p>
            <p>The particular Inſtances, and manner of Manageing theſe Crueltys, they ſay, exceed all former Examples of a Ferile and Implacable Diſpoſition, and if they were put together, would fill a Hiſtory. They ſay, you will ſee full Proof of this in The <hi>Netherland Historian,</hi> Printed at <hi>Amsterdam, Anno.</hi> 1675. And Tranſlated out of the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Book firſt open'd to me at p. 117. Where is the Story of Collonel and Quarter Maſter General <hi>Pain and Vin,</hi> who, they ſay, was pitch'd upon as the Sacrifice to ſave the Reputation of the States, and the New-made <hi>State-holder,</hi> upon the Irruption the <hi>French</hi> made into their Country, in <hi>December</hi> 72. When they took and Deſtroyed <hi>Boode grave, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>mmardam, &amp;c.</hi> The blame was laid upon Collonel <hi>Pain and Vin,</hi> his Cowardice and Correſpondence with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, elſe they had Routed the <hi>French</hi> (no Doubt!) Therefore his Highneſs had Collonel <hi>Pain and Vin</hi> brought before a Council of War, which, 10. <hi>Janu.</hi> 72/73. Condemn'd him to perpetual Baniſhment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But found nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Death againſt him. But this could by no means Satisfy his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> who by his Letter, there inſented of the 19. <hi>Janu.</hi> 73. Ordered a Second Tryal, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with all Strictneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which was done: And the Council of War 16. <hi>Janu.</hi> 73. Perſiſted in their former Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, only added (to appeaſe the Wrath of his Highneſs) that the Priſoner ſhould be brought to the Place of Publick Execution, and there by the <hi>Hang-Man</hi> to have a Sword Sway'd over his Head <hi>Thus Reſolv'd at</hi> Alphen <hi>the</hi> 16. <hi>Janu.</hi> 73. But his Highneſs's Thirſt was not thus to be Aſſwag'd, it muſt be Quench'd (as <hi>Soloman</hi> in the Siege of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> ſays to his General, <hi>By Rhodium Blood or Thine</hi>—) If not by <hi>French,</hi> yet by firth Blood as was in his Power to Spill. Therefore he Orders a <hi>Third</hi> Tryal, and himſelf Sate Judge, and his <hi>Highneſs</hi> in his <hi>own Perſon</hi> (for no other would do
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65103:29"/> it) Condemn'd the Priſoner to Death, with particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for ſpeedy Execution: <hi>Which Sentence</hi> (ſays the Hiſtory) <hi>on the</hi> 23. <hi>was Pronounced at</hi> Alphen, <hi>and the ſame Day Executed, his Head being Cut off at the Third Stroak, but he to the very laſt, kept to his former Proteſtation, againſt his having had any Communication with the Enemy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome were ſuſpicious, but Accuſed him of bare Cawardice.</hi> Thus that Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>And there was ſome body would have had <hi>Admiral Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> brought to a <hi>Second</hi> Tryal for his being beat at Sea by the <hi>French</hi> in the Year 90. But that Trick would not do here (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) at leaſt ſo ſoon.</p>
            <p>Sir, I will not take up your time with Hundreds of ſuch Inſtances which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do Urge, nor do expect that you ſhould Anſwer them all particularly. It will be Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, but if you can find ſomething to ſay to them in the General, it will do well.</p>
            <p>But I cannot Omit that never-Dying Story of the <hi>De-Wits,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do make ſo great Noiſe with it. They deſire us to obſerve the ſeveral Steps and Degrees, by which his Highneſs Advanced himſelf to the <hi>State-Holder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> over the bellys of theſe <hi>Brothers,</hi> whom the 'boveſaid <hi>Dutch Hiſtory,</hi> p. 70. Calls the Greateſt Wits and Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of the World. And they ſay, you will find many Strokes in all that Management of the ſame Refin'd Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as in this Revolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> that his Highneſs's Partizans had taken care to have it Spread through the whole Country, that the <hi>De-Wits</hi> had Secret Deſigns to Betray them to the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Nation being thus Subſtantially Poiſon'd with an ill Opinion of their Governours, next, the <hi>Mobb</hi> is ſet on Foot to Demand of their Magiſtrates, that his Highneſs ſhould be amde <hi>State-Holder</hi> without Delay. This was prettily Coppy'd, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> by Lord <hi>L.</hi> who Headed the <hi>London Mobb</hi> into <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> with Papers in their Hatts, Demanding his Highneſs to be made King, when the two Houſes of <hi>Convention</hi> ſeem'd to be Doubtful about the Matter. But after this they ſoon came to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:65103:29"/>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh Mobb</hi> upon this Revolution, did imitate their <hi>Masters</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> as if the ſame Spirit had poſſeſſed them, and they had both Acted upon the ſame Cauſe and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>But in this there was a Remarkable Difference, that as the aboveſaid Hiſtory tells, p. 45. They turn'd out all the Miniſters of the <hi>De-Wit</hi> and <hi>Louveſtayn</hi> Faction: But here K. <hi>James</hi>'s Arbitrary Miniſters are ſtill employed, tho' all the Complaints in his Highneſs's <hi>Declaration</hi> are only againſt theſe Miniſters, and no otherwiſe againſt K. <hi>James</hi> than by an <hi>Innuondo,</hi> that he muſt of neceſſity Deſign to Reign Arbitrarily, whenever it ſhould be in his Power, becauſe he made uſe of ſuch Miniſters, it muſt be ſuppos'd, with that Proſpect of Arriving at full Arbitrarineſs in time by the help of their Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>In the next place the <hi>Jacobites</hi> do Obſerve, That as our Preſent Revolution was brought about by Diſſolving all our Former <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Obligations,</hi> ſo it was in <hi>Holland.</hi> 25. of <hi>Feb.</hi> 72. ſays the boveſaid Hiſtory, p. 7. <hi>His Highneſs was made Captain General over the Forces of the State, but with all poſſible Reſtrictions, an Oath having been taken of him, That he ſhould never ſeek to be</hi> State-Holder <hi>of any of the Provinces, nor accept of it, if he ſhould be deſired to it.</hi> Yet he was made <hi>State-Holder</hi> within <hi>Four Months</hi> after this. <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>June.</hi> 72.</p>
            <p>The States had likewiſe made a <hi>Perpetual Edict</hi> againſt Electing a <hi>State-Holder,</hi> and Sworn to it.</p>
            <p>But the Hiſtory tells. p. 44. That 29. <hi>June.</hi> 72. <hi>The Lords thus Terrify'd</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> by the Threatnings of the <hi>Mobb</hi>) <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves, and alſo his Highneſs of their Oath concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Perpetual Edict, <hi>and ſo made him</hi> State-Holder — <hi>As alſo the Magistrates of moſt of the Citys of</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> Zealand, <hi>were, about that time, either through Actual Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Threatned Peril, Forced ſo to Advance his Highneſs; Whereupon by the Deputys of the Citys, having a Voice, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the States of</hi> Holland, <hi>the</hi> Perpetual Edict <hi>was Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd,</hi> July 1. <hi>and ſo by the Annulling that Oath, the Members made Capable to Elect a</hi> State-Holder. <hi>Thus the Historian.</hi>

            <p>In this Revolution, the two Brothers, the <hi>De-Wits</hi> were <hi>Non-Swearers.</hi> But in Vain, for <hi>Cornel. De Wit</hi> Ruart of <hi>Putten,</hi> and Old Burgo-Maſter of <hi>Dort, by the Perſwaſions of his Wife, and the Lords Preſent, but Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally by the Threatnings of the Citizens, was Conſtrained thereto:</hi> ſays the Hiſtory. p. 44. And <hi>if ever any thing fell out to be Wondred at</hi> (ſays he, p. 45.) <hi>it was this — That both the Brothers the</hi> De-Wits <hi>were by Indiſpoſedneſs hindred, one at</hi> Dort, <hi>the</hi> 29. June, <hi>the other at the</hi> Hague, July, 1. and 3. <hi>to be Preſent at the Council: And the Caſe was ſo Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, that there was no time to Adviſe with theſe Lords: For who knoweth, but by their great Subtilty they yet might have found ſome hindrance to this Work.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>De-Wits</hi> finding it Impoſſible to withſtand the Torrent of this Prince, carryed upon the Shoulders of the <hi>Mobb,</hi> who had broke throw all the Dykes and Fences of their Laws, Sanctions of <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Edicts, &amp;c.</hi> Reſolv'd to Appeaſe him by Sacrifice, and giving up all their Power and Authority which might ſtand in his way, or be an Eye-Sore to his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Accordingly <hi>Johan. De-Wit,</hi> Great Councellor, and Pentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Frizeland,</hi> having upon the 1. of <hi>Aug.</hi> 72. Complemented his Highneſs upon his Illuſtrious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Advance (ſays the Hiſtory, p. 63.) did on the 4th. in the Aſſembly of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> lay down his Office of <hi>Pontionarſhip.</hi> His Brother <hi>Cornel. De-Wit Ruart</hi> of the Land of <hi>Putten,</hi> had before <hi>viz.</hi> 24. of <hi>July</hi> been brought Priſoner from <hi>Dort</hi> to the <hi>Hague.</hi> And being thus Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the Feet of his Highneſs, they thought they might have liv'd ſafe, at leaſt as to their <hi>Lives,</hi> under his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. For they fear'd no Tryal but that of the <hi>Mobb,</hi> being Confident, that as to all Matters of the <hi>State,</hi> they could ſufficiently clear themſelves in any Judicature, where they could be heard. And nothing of it was ever ſo much as. Objected againſt them in any Judicature: Only blown about amongſt the <hi>Populace,</hi> by the Humble Servants of his <hi>Highneſs:</hi> Who, ſome ſay, did under-hand Promote thoſe
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65103:30"/> ill Meaſures, which they afterwards did Aggravate againſt the <hi>De-Wits,</hi> and that on purpoſe to Diſguſt the Nation at them; as <hi>Great Britain</hi>'s <hi>Complaint,</hi> ſays <hi>Sunder.</hi> and others ſet on by his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> ſerved King <hi>James,</hi> who made theſe Blotts, They knew ſo well how to hit.</p>
            <p>But our Scene is now in <hi>Holland.</hi> His Highneſs could not forget the Oppoſition, which the <hi>Ruart Cornel. De-Wit</hi> gave him at <hi>Dort,</hi> about 29. of <hi>June.</hi> 72. Where his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs firſt ſet up for <hi>State-Holder-ſhip.</hi> But the <hi>Ruart</hi> would have Preſerv'd the Conſtitution of the Government, to which, both his Highneſs and they were Sworn: And he would have minded his Highneſs of his <hi>Declaration,</hi> and that upon <hi>Oath,</hi> made but Four Months before, <hi>viz.</hi> 25. of <hi>Febru.</hi> 72. When he was made <hi>Captain General,</hi> that he had no. Aim at the <hi>State-Holder-ſhip,</hi> that he would neither ſeek it, not accept of it, if it ſhould be offered to him. Tho' ſome, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> at that time were ſo hardned againſt any good Opinion of the Sincerity of <hi>that Prince,</hi> that they believ'd (as it prov'd) that an <hi>Oath</hi> would never keep him back from the <hi>State-Holderſhip,</hi> or even from a <hi>Crown,</hi> if he could make his way to it.</p>
            <p>But the Fall of the <hi>Ruart De-Wit</hi> from all his Greatneſs and Authority, could by no means Satisfy his Highneſs's Fury. And ſince no Miſcariage, as to the State, could be laid to the <hi>Ruart</hi>'s Charge, <hi>one of his Highneſs</hi>'s <hi>Domestiques</hi> (ſays Sir <hi>Will-Temple</hi> in his <hi>Memories.</hi> p. 21.) the 'bove quoted Hiſtory, calls him a <hi>Barber.</hi> p. 67. Accuſed the <hi>Ruart</hi> for endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Mony to Engage him in a Deſign againſt the Prince's Life. But no other Witneſs appearing, he was Sentenc'd to be Baniſhed; without any Crime in the World Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd or Named in the Sentence, which is inſerted in the 'boveſaid Hiſtory, p. 67. and ſays only as the Ground of their Sentence, that <hi>having conſidered what was in the Caſe to be taken Notice of, or might any ways be ſerviceable in it, do Declare the Priſoner to be</hi> Baniſhed, &amp;c. <hi>any way Serviceable!</hi> Serviceable to what? Say the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> to Pleaſe the Prince's Spleen. Was there ever ſuch
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65103:31"/> a Naked Sentence? It ſpeaks as plainly as the <hi>Judges</hi> Durſt, that they did not think him Guilty, but being Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of a Deſign againſt his Highneſs's Life, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation carry'd on by one of his Highneſs's own <hi>Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick</hi> Servants, they muſt conſider what they could find in the Caſe to be <hi>Serviceable</hi> to his Highneſs. Yet it was not Serviceable, he will not be Serv'd by Halves. <hi>Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> will not do, where the Thirſt is after <hi>Blood.</hi> And ſince the <hi>Judges</hi> will not go the length, nor the <hi>Law</hi> will bear it, the never-ſailing <hi>Mobb</hi> muſt be Rouz'd up again. The Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry p. 28. ſays, they were <hi>ſet on by the Inſtigation of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> This was a Diligent Officer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We know</hi> (ſays a Later <hi>Dutch</hi> Account, Written in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> 6. <hi>Nov.</hi> 76.) <hi>that the Houſe-hold Servants of</hi> Zuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtain, <hi>the Baſtard of Prince</hi> Henry, <hi>and other Ruffians were Employed in the Maſſacre of the</hi> De-Wits, <hi>and Stirred up all the Towns against their Rulers, and with Violence and Force Promoted the</hi> Prince <hi>and his Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort. Both the <hi>De-Wits</hi> were Tore in pieces by this Godly <hi>Mobb,</hi> thus ſet on, and Inſtigated. And no <hi>States-Men</hi> of the Age left a Greater Character, either of their Ability, or Integrity. Sir <hi>Will. Temple</hi> in his <hi>Memoires</hi> p. 22. ſpeaking of <hi>John De-Wit,</hi> ſays, <hi>Thus ended one of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Lives of any Subject in our Age — after having ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or rather Adminiſtred that State as Pentioner of</hi> Holland, <hi>for about Eighteen Years, with Great Honour to his Country and himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> Obſerve that his Highneſs could not find even. <hi>Dutch</hi> Judges or Jury would believe ſuch Great Men ought to Dye, or would be Guilty of ſuch mean Plots, and poorly contriv'd, only becauſe <hi>his</hi> Barber <hi>told him ſo.</hi> And one of them was not ſo much as Accuſed. The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory owns, p. 70. That <hi>no certain Evidence, or Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the one, or Accuſation of the other have been made known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, Sir, theſe are Old Storys. There is a Later Inſtance which I have heard from the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and they ſay it is of a Piece with all the reſt.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:65103:31"/>
            <p>In the Year 89. when the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> Contended againſt having a Foraign King for their <hi>State-Holder,</hi> and Meen Heer <hi>B.</hi> was ſent over to Act on the Part of the <hi>State-Holder;</hi> and finding Difficulty's ariſe, the Old Politick was again ſet on Foot, ſay the <hi>Jacobites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Koin</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> (who is Famous' for Contriving, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the General Impoſt upon Coffee there, whether they Drink any or not) Swore againſt two of the moſt Troubleſom of theſe Burghers. That they offer'd to Bribe him to Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the <hi>State-Holder.</hi> They remembred <hi>De-wit, Pain</hi> and <hi>Vin,</hi> and well knew the Conſequence, and the Meaning of ſuch Accuſations: And were glad to Learn how to give their Votes as they ought to do: and others took Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo the Point was Carry'd.</p>
            <p>But when the Tryal of the <hi>Burghers</hi> came on, there was but a ſingle Evidence, as there was againſt <hi>De-Wit;</hi> and the <hi>Jew</hi> was believ'd as little as the <hi>Barber.</hi> But had not ſo good Luck. For upon the <hi>Burghers</hi> being acquit, the <hi>Jew</hi> was Baniſh'd the Territorys of <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> They durſt proceed no farther at that time againſt him.</p>
            <p>During his Baniſhment, he thought himſelf Neglected by his Patron <hi>Meen Heer B.</hi> And began to Blabb it out who it was that ſet him on to Swear againſt the <hi>Burghers.</hi> Who hearing of it, found ſome means to bring him to <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> Where they had him firſt Arreſted for Debt (for they were afraid to venture too far, knowing whom they had to deal with) and ſeeing none come to Relieve him, concluded that the Drudgery of Swearing being over, his Patron had no farther uſe for him, and therefore proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring him upon the Stage for this Conſpiracy againſt their Lives, and to Diſcover his Accomplices. Being, put to the Torture he did Confeſs. Was Sentenc'd to the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory,</hi> and to the <hi>Raſp-houſe</hi> (their <hi>Bridwell</hi>) for Six Years, where I ſuppoſe he now is to be found.</p>
            <p>But there is one thing Extraordinary. The Confeſſion of this <hi>Koin</hi> is kept up, tho' it be the Cuſtom there always to Publiſh the Confeſſion of thoſe who are Sentenc'd, after being put to the Torture, for the Vindication of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:65103:32"/>
            <p>This (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) is like keeping the Tryals of the fore-mentioned Friars. <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Thursby</hi> out of the Printed Account of the Seſſions at <hi>Old-Baily, Sept.</hi> 92.</p>
            <p>In this Claſs of <hi>Sham-Plots</hi> and <hi>Impostures,</hi> they mind us to make a farther Examination into the Buſineſs of <hi>Fuller,</hi> who Swore many Noble Lords and others into a Plot; his Grace of <hi>Canterbury Sancraft</hi> the Chief. It is certain he has been ſet up, and ſupported by ſome Body. They deſire us to inquire, and we will find that he had a Bill of 200<hi>l.</hi> this Summer from Meen Heer <hi>B.</hi> above mentioned: And before that, he drew a Bill of 50<hi>l.</hi> from <hi>Flanders,</hi> to the Great Man at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> by the Name of his Uncle, who paid it. And ſaid he would do more than that for him, if he performed what he had Engaged to him.</p>
            <p>It would be ask'd likewiſe how he came to be kept from his Tryal all this Summer, the H. of Commons laſt Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having Voted him an Impoſtor, and deſired that the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney General might Proſecute him, and yet that was forgot, till the Parliament was ready to to Meet this Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>And the firſt Day of his ſtanding in the Pillory, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sentence, was diſappointed, the Pillory being ſet up, but no <hi>Fuller</hi> came, and it was taken down again.</p>
            <p>Which made ſo great an Out-cry, and gave ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, and Jealouſy, as is not cur'd by his being ſet afterwards in the Pillory; for it ſhewed how unwillingly it was done, and meerly to ſtop Peoples Mouths.</p>
            <p>There is Greater Care taken (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) of his Colleague <hi>Young,</hi> who Counterfeited Arch Biſhop <hi>Sancroft</hi>'s Hand and others, and ſee them to an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> (he has the Honour to be ſet out by the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi>'s Pen) for <hi>Blackhead</hi> the Evidence againſt him, becauſe of his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. (a Taylor) muſt not be ſent to Goal, but has been ſuffered to make his Eſcape from a Meſſenger in the <hi>Savoy; Aaron Smith</hi> is a Greater Scandal than theſe, being Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly Own'd, and Employ'd by the Government, as a Plot-journey-Man. His Life would make a Hiſtory. When many
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65103:32"/> Lords and others were lately Commited contrary to Law, without any Information upon Oath againſt them, The Matter was indeavour'd to be folv'd up by <hi>Aaron Smith</hi>'s making Oath, that he had informations againſt them, which he did: But when it came to the Teſt, he could produce none; and ſo they were forc'd to Diſcharge thoſe they had Illegally Impriſoned: But <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> not Puniſh'd for his Evident <hi>Perjury,</hi> and <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> againſt the Lives of ſo many Noble and Worthy Gentlemen. Sir, forgive my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating theſe <hi>Things</hi> from the Mouths of the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> they muſt be told, to the end, that their Mouths may be ſtopp'd, and we may all know (for no doubt you do) how to Anſwer them.</p>
            <p>There are many other Paſſages of Different Natures, which give great Scandal againſt the Government. The Princes <hi>Ann</hi> Flying from her Father did not more Allarme the People of <hi>England</hi> (of ſome Deep, and they could not tell what Deſign on Foot) than her Royal Highneſs preſent Quarrel with her Siſter, and of ſo long Continuance, does Amaze and Diſtract the Common People. They think all is Wrong. There is ſomething at the Bottom more than we know. Is it ſo, that there is not one Wiſe Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us to take away, or ſome way Compoſe ſo Fatal a Breach, 'twixt thoſe in <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Expectance</hi> of the Crown? At leaſt, not to ſuffer it to Riſe to ſuch an Extravagant height, as to have their Guards taken from their Royal Highneſſes, and Publick Affronts and Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys put upon them in all Places, and that by Order from Her Majeſty: One of theſe came to my hands, and is here under Written. It was ſent to Attend upon her Highneſs to the <hi>Bath</hi> laſt Summer, and follows in theſe Words.</p>

            <p>Forbidding to pay ſuch Reſpect to her Royal Highneſs, as is uſually paid to the Royal Family, looks like another P. of <hi>Wales</hi> Diſcovery (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) as if People had leave given them to Doubt whether ſhe were of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family; or ſo near as is believed to the Crown: Why elſe (ſay they) ſhould the Reſpects which are uſually paid to the Royal Family be Deny'd to her? And the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary himſelf forgets her Stile of <hi>Royal</hi> Highneſs, that every one may have a Pluck at her: Plain <hi>Highneſs</hi> muſt ſerve her Turn, till ſhe Learn better Manners.</p>
            <p>The Executioner gave K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. the Stile of <hi>his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> when we was going to Cut off his Head.</p>
            <p>Can the Queens Diſpleaſure forfeit the Princeſs Title and Quality, which ſhe has by being K. <hi>James</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Or muſt ſhe have the Stile of <hi>Late,</hi> added to her Royalty, like her Father?</p>
            <p>And the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) who Run away with the Princeſs in his Jack-Boots, and Sword Drawn, to be the Man pitch'd upon, after her <hi>Late Royal</hi> High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Return to <hi>London</hi> from the <hi>Bath,</hi> to give Orders to Dr. <hi>Birch</hi> of St. <hi>James</hi>'s Church (in which Pariſh ſhe had taken a Houſe to Live in) not to pay her any of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects uſually paid to the Royal Family, ſuch as ſending her the Text, to wait for her Coming, or make any Obeiſance to her.</p>
            <p>But no doubt it is all for the good of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion!</hi> And it is hard (ſay the Rogues of <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi>)
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65103:33"/> if when theſe fall out, ſome Honeſt Men do not come by their Rights!</p>
            <p>Sir, it had been much to be Wiſh'd, for the Honour of the Government. That this Civil War of the <hi>Royal Siſters</hi> had not been ſo Expos'd.</p>
            <p>And it had not been of leſs Importance, at leaſt to her Majeſtys <hi>Rep.</hi> if the Extraordinary Greatneſs and Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhe has of Late Contracted with the Counteſs of <hi>D.</hi> had not been altogether ſo Notorious.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> Laugh in their Sleeves, and make Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, That our Godly Queen, who for the ſake of Religion, has Forſaken her Father; ſhould at the ſame time Careſs the Great Inſtrument of his Sin, and his Shame.</p>
            <p>Who, to Teſtify her Repentance, makes it her Common-Practice to Rail at K. <hi>James.</hi> Condeſending even to call him Names, and the <hi>Billings-Gate</hi> Rethorick: And to diſown all Obligations from him.</p>
            <p>And for a Penance, ſhe Submits to a Scandalous Office of an Informer, to Betray his Secrets, and his Friends who Truſted her: And, becauſe ſhe does every thing to the Utmoſt, ſhe ſpares not to ſhew her Wit at Invention, where ſhe wants Truth to fill up an Accuſation.</p>
            <p>For theſe Good Works, ſhe is allowed now out of the Secret-Service-Money, <hi>Five Hundred pounds</hi> a Week, Paid her by <hi>Hen. Guy,</hi> Secretary to the Treaſury: And is to have an Order for <hi>Ten</hi> or <hi>Twelve Thouſand pounds</hi> Arrears of a Grant given her from King <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Thirty Five Hundred pounds</hi> a Year, out of the Quit-Rents of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Beſides the Extraordinary Preſents from <hi>B.</hi> in a Corner which no Body muſt know.</p>
            <p>For all which ſhe is ſo Greatfully Good Natur'd, as to Bragg in her Cabals how, Dextrouſly ſhe can Manage this Government, that, as her Phraſe is (and that not over Privately) ſhe can make what ſhe Pleaſe paſs upon them; and, as an Inſtance, has Sold them a Treaſurer, to Secure her own Payments, Sir <hi>E. S.</hi> that Good Man! Who never was Unconſtant to his Principle of Changing to the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſide. This is not out of her Diſaffection to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65103:34"/> But ſome, you know, would rather looſe their Friend than their Jeſt.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Sund.</hi> ſhould be a Pentioner of this Government, and ſo own'd by King <hi>William</hi> in the Liſt of Pentioners, given into the Parliament, cannot be more Explanatory of his Declaration (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) than Queen <hi>Marys</hi> chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lady <hi>D.</hi> for her Confidant, is a Demonſtration of the true Figure of <hi>her Holineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that Father <hi>Simon</hi> alias, <hi>Patrick,</hi> ſhould be pitch'd upon for Confeſſor and Guide of this Holy Confederacy, ſeems ſtrangly Conſequential to all the Devotional Tracts Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And; the Education of the Young Lady <hi>K. D.</hi> in the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> being the pretence of this Kindneſs on the Sudden, that he ſhould perform this Charge ſo Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that, beſides the Example of her Mothers Vertue, ſhe has the Inſtruction of two other Penitents in the ſame Trade, Ladies of Skill, and Famous through the Whole Town (that we need not Name them) who are both <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks,</hi> and Daily Gueſts at the Counteſſes Table.</p>
            <p>Not that her Ladyſhip retains the leaſt Teſt of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Converſation, but only in Zeal, to make Converts of them too: For this is a Reforming Age! And Generouſly like <hi>Lot,</hi> would rather Expoſe her own Daughter, to Learn all the Vices of <hi>Sodom,</hi> than fail in her Hoſpitality to theſe two <hi>Angles,</hi> who are come under her Roof.</p>
            <p>But as the Biſhop of <hi>L.</hi> (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) who thought he had Cemented the two Siſters unalterably, by making them Quit their Father, to meet one another, has yet liv'd to be made an Inſtrument in their Quarrel, the late Biſhop of <hi>E.</hi> may have the ſame luck, in good time, with the <hi>Third</hi> Siſter, who is now put into his Hands.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Jacobites</hi> deſire us to conſider, That this Child may come in her Turn to the Crown. For ſhe is onely <hi>not next in Blood:</hi> And what Great Matter is that, ſo it be kept in the Royal Family? The Succeſſion goes on ſtill, tho' ſhe ſhould Uſurp in her Siſters Life time. And if that ſhou'd be for the Good of Religion —</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:65103:34"/>
            <p>Therefore her Education ought to be a <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, at leaſt a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> not to leave an Innocent Child, where ſhe can ſee nothing but what may Corrupt her.</p>
            <p>And if there can be any Cauſe ſufficient to Warrant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifulneſs to a Parent, this Lady has more to Plead, than either of her Siſters. For it muſt be Confeſs'd on all Hands, That her Mother is not the beſt Company for her in the World: And it would be an Advantage to her, if ſhe could forget that ſhe had ſuch a Mother: And to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (eſpecially to her Pious Majeſty) that ſuch a <hi>Cabinet Councellor</hi> had not yet come within <hi>White-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, I cou'd heap up Inſtances of this Nature upon you, of which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> have Catalogues: Upon which ſingly, tho' the leaſt ſtreſs is laid, yet by their Number they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Weight. And in drawing up the Forces of the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites,</hi> we muſt not only ſhew you their <hi>Goliahs,</hi> ſuch as <hi>De-Wit, Gler-Coe, Grandval, Koin,</hi> &amp;c. each of which ſingle is an Army of Objections againſt us.</p>
            <p>But I muſt likewiſe lead out the <hi>Setters</hi> and <hi>Small-Fry, Fuller, Young, Blackhead, Aaron Smith,</hi> and <hi>Lady D.</hi> for theſe, tho' not ſo Glorious, are as uſeful as the other. The <hi>Lyon</hi> cannot hunt without his <hi>Jackall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, I wou'd not have made this Muſter, but to enflame your Zeal to Vindicate the Government, and Reconcile the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> of which they give us good hopes, if any toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Anſwer can be given to what is here Objected by them.</p>
            <p>Wherein if you can be an Inſtrument, I ſuppoſe you will reckon it the moſt Glorious Scene of your Life; and not be Diſpleas'd with your Humble Servant, by offering theſe Objections of our Adverſarys, to put it in your, Power, to Oblige your Self and your Nation to ſo High a Degree, as to make them one with us again.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, in the ſame Freedom that I have Dealt with you, let me Intreat you, in your Management of all this, for the ſake of theſe <hi>Dull Jacobites,</hi> that you would Curb the excuberance of your Wit, it is but loſt upon them; They are a <hi>Plain Down-right</hi> ſort of People, and Love
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65103:35"/> 
               <hi>Plain Sence and Reaſon,</hi> they will never be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you <hi>Politicks,</hi> when you reſine them to that Degree as you do? p. 12. where you prove that King <hi>James</hi> will have no Reguard to the <hi>Non-Swearers,</hi> who loſt their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, rather than take an Oath of Allegiance to King <hi>William,</hi> becauſe of the Title which they think King <hi>James</hi> has to their Allegiance: For ſay you, <hi>they did it not for hic (K.</hi> James's) <hi>ſake, but for another, and better Reaſon, for fear of being Damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Jacobites</hi> think that no King can have a better hold of any Subjects Loyalty, than of thoſe who believe they will be <hi>Damned,</hi> if they be Diſloyal.</p>
            <p>And that (notwithſtanding of all you ſay) every King wou'd deſire ſuch Subjects, and conſequently would Encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſuch more than any other Subjects.</p>
            <p>They are likewiſe utterly uncapable of ever coming up to what you Advance p. 13/14. <hi>That their very Boldneſs and Reſolution in Oppoſing their preſent Majeſtys, will be thought no Virtue fit to be Rewarded by a Prince,</hi> that is, by King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Reaſons are Subtile. The firſt is, That their Oppoſing their preſent Majeſties, is <hi>upon a meer Paint of Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What if it were? Say the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> if that point of Law be Aſſerting K. <hi>James</hi>'s Right? Will he for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon think it no Vertue, nor fit to be Rewarded? This paſſes a <hi>Jacobites</hi> underſtanding!</p>
            <p>But Secondly, you know they pretend <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and the Law of <hi>GOD,</hi> unleſs you mean by a <hi>meer Point of Law,</hi> a Point of <hi>GOD</hi>'s <hi>Law.</hi> And the very Page before (p. 12.) you confeſs that their Refuſing the Oaths, and Looſing their Preferments is <hi>for another, and a better Reaſon, for ſear of being Damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from thence you endeavour to prove that K. <hi>James</hi> owes them no thanks for it, becauſe it is not for his ſake they do it, but their own, <hi>for fear of being Damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Jacobites</hi> will certainly ſay, that you prove your Aſſertion from quite contrary Topicks. One, that King <hi>James</hi> will not care for the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> becauſe they Act out
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65103:35"/> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> only <hi>for fear of being Damn'd:</hi> The other, that K. <hi>James</hi> will not care for them, becauſe they <hi>do not</hi> Act out of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but <hi>upon a meer Point of Law.</hi> This they call <hi>Fiſhing</hi> for Arguments; and he that ſeeks will find.</p>
            <p>They deſire to know whether it be a Fault to be Loyal upon a Principle? So that if we have any Reaſon for our Loyalty, we forfeit all pretence to Thanks or Reward? if we be Loyal upon the point of <hi>Law.</hi> Then no Thanks to you ſays the King (as you, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> wou'd have him Speak) becauſe you are Loyal, <hi>upon a meer point of Law.</hi> If we be Loyal upon point of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Then, no thanks to you again, for that is only <hi>for fear of being Damn'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe then we be Loyal without any Reaſon in the World, but by meer Chance, or a Fancy, that, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> they find to be the only Loyalty you think Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious: Becauſe, having no other Reaſon for it, it muſt be ſuppos'd to be only out of Love to the Kings Perſon, for a <hi>Handſome Noſe,</hi> a <hi>Sweet Breath, Graceful Meen, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable Temper,</hi> or what pleaſes your Fancy. But you muſt have a Care that you have no Solid or Subſtantial Reaſon, ſuch as the Preſervation of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion, Liberty, Property,</hi> &amp;c. For then, no thanks to you, it is for them, and not the King you are Concern'd. But moſt of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Pretending <hi>Conſcience,</hi> For then it is <hi>only for fear of being Damn'd.</hi> A <hi>Weather-Cock Loyalty</hi> (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) fits you beſt, it will Turn and Wind, and not be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome at an Unſeaſonable Time, and therefore you think it deſerves moſt Thanks: But they think, <hi>not from the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, this Argument of yours overturns all Duty, Humane and Religious: And makes them wholly Inconſiſtent with any Gratitude or Reward, from Men at leaſt: So that if <hi>Children</hi> or <hi>Servants</hi> be <hi>Dutifull,</hi> if <hi>Wives</hi> be <hi>Loyal,</hi> or <hi>Friends Juſt,</hi> here is no thanks, if they do it out of any Principle of <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you do not Truſt to theſe Arguments, you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. That theſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> Boldneſs and Reſolution in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65103:36"/> Oppoſing their preſent Majeſties — will be thought no Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by a Prince, <hi>who wou'd make his Will Superior to all Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, a Prince would not deſire his Subjects to be <hi>Firm</hi> in their Loyalty to him, for fear they might be <hi>Firm like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi> in ſomething elſe that might Diſpleaſe him.</p>
            <p>This is too Superfine for theſe <hi>Jacobites,</hi> they Cry out, that it is the ſame as if a General ſhould not deſire Stout Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, leaſt they ſhould be as Stout, if they ſhould Turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: As if a Man ſhould deſire a <hi>Weak</hi> Horſe for his Journey, becauſe if a <hi>Strong</hi> Horſe ſhould prove Subborn, he could diſpute it harder with me. Or if I ſhould chooſe Knaviſh Servants, and <hi>Fickle,</hi> whoſe Principle it were to <hi>Deſert</hi> me, and take on with my Enemy, when ever they were Diſpleaſed; for fear if they they ſhould be Firm to me, they might be Firm againſt me. All theſe, and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty other Inſtances of the like Nature are as Feaſable, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> as that a Prince (let him deſire never ſo much to be Abſolute) ſhould be diſpleaſed at the Firmneſs of his Subjects Fidelity, or their having an <hi>Inflexible Conſcience</hi> (as you Word it) as to their <hi>Loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> profeſs, they can no more believe it, than that a Husband ſhould be Sorry his Wife were. True and Loving to him; leaſt if ſhe ſhould happen to Love another, ſhe might be as True and Loving to him, becauſe he found, it in her Temper to be Firm and Conſtant in her Love.</p>
            <p>Theſe, Sir, are Flights of Jealouſy in <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Husband,</hi> which leſſer Wits than yours have the Happineſs not to know: And therefore deſire you would not throw away ſuch Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificient and Strong Sence upon them, for they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be the better for it, they would not be Diſturb'd with it.</p>
            <p>But yet they Confeſs, that you have found out Grounds for all this Jealouſy, which they ſhould never have thought on; and they ſtand amaz'd at the acuteneſs of your Wit, which could Search ſo Deep, as to find Reaſons why Wives may Leave their Husbands, and Subjects <hi>Abdicate</hi> their Prince at their Pleaſure. And nothing is ſo Surpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65103:36"/> as theſe Reaſons which you produce for this, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Wife may be Raviſhed, and forc'd from her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, therefore it is, Lawful for her to yield to an <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,</hi> Nay, to invite him to come, and Drive away her <hi>Husband,</hi> to Intrigue with this <hi>Gallant</hi> under-hand, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and Aſſiſt him to Frighten her <hi>Husband</hi> out of his Houſe to ſave his Life, and then to make a Preſent of it, together with her ſelf, to her <hi>Deliverer.</hi> And then it is Juſtly and Legally their own, for, <hi>What made him Run away and leave his Houſe?</hi> And his Wife holds ſtill. Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to her Matrimonial Vow; ſhe only <hi>Change; the Object,</hi> ſhe is for <hi>Matrimony</hi> ſtill: And therefore, by her Vow to her <hi>Firſt</hi> Husband, ſhe is Bound to the <hi>Second.</hi> She only Transferrs her Allegiance: And therefore it is the ſame Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance ſtill.</p>
            <p>All this the <hi>Jacobites</hi> think is the Conſequence of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this Revolution, with the Conqueſt of the <hi>French King</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. (p. 7.) Becauſe they are Raviſhed, and Forc'd from their Natural King, therefore you would Inſinuate that your Caſe is the ſame, who Invited over a Foraign Prince, Intrigu'd with him under hand, did Aſſiſt him to Frighten away our Natural and Lawful King, to Save his Life, and then made a Preſent of his Crown, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with your Selves, to your <hi>New Deliverer,</hi> from the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of an <hi>Old Husband:</hi> And all his Poſſeſſions are now Juſtly your own, for, <hi>What made him Run away and Leave his Kingdom?</hi> We are ſtill Faithful to our Oath of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance;</hi> we only <hi>Change the Object;</hi> we are for <hi>Monarchy</hi> ſtill; and therefore by our Oath of Allegiance to K. <hi>James,</hi> we are Bound to K. <hi>William</hi> (which is a Topick taken up in <hi>Soloman</hi> and <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and ſeveral of our late Pamphlets) for, ſay they, we only <hi>Transferr</hi> our Allegiance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the ſame Allegiance ſtill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Jacobites</hi> deſire you to remember, that <hi>Marriage</hi> is a <hi>Mutual Contract;</hi> and there is a Due Benevolence and Duty on both ſides, which if either Party (the Husband as well as the Wife) ſhall Neglect, or be Guilty of Male Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, why ſhould he not be Depos'd, <hi>Propter Inuti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Imperium,</hi> and Good-Womam have the leave to chooſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65103:37"/> another Husband? And yet our ſevere Law will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it.</p>
            <p>If you ſay there are Divorces in <hi>Marriage;</hi> and why not in <hi>Government?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They will anſwer, That for the Caſe of <hi>Adultery only,</hi> Divorce is Allowed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and Conſequently in our <hi>Law.</hi> But that neither <hi>Scripture</hi> nor our <hi>Law,</hi> Allows of <hi>any Caſe,</hi> wherein it ſhall be Lawful for Subjects to take Arms againſt their King, but on the Contrary, Declares it to be unlawful <hi>upon any Pretence whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they make uſe of this as a ſtrong Argument againſt us. For (ſay they) The Law of God and of the Land, would have made Exceptions in the one, as well as in the other, if they had thought it Reaſonable. And therefore that we muſt not make Exceptions againſt the Laws, both of God and Man.</p>
            <p>But to come cloſe to the Matter without Smiles or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuendo's. They Deſire your Anſwer, whether if <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Furnes</hi> had Invited the <hi>French</hi> to come thither, and had Betray'd theſe Towns into their Hands, whether this could, in Juſtice and Good Conſcience, have excus'd their Transferring their Allegiance, and Swearing Oaths to the <hi>French King?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you do not ſpeak plainly to this, they ſay, you do not come up to the Caſe in hand.</p>
            <p>Unleſs you will ſay (as ſome of late have done) that the P. of <hi>Orange</hi> has Conquered <hi>England,</hi> as much as the <hi>French King</hi> has <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And that tho' he does not at preſent ſet up the Title of <hi>Conqueſt</hi> (for what Cauſe he thinks fit) yet that he has it in's Sleeve, and may juſtly ſet it up when he Pleaſes, For which <hi>Gilbert</hi>'s <hi>Paſtoral,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Licenſed</hi> Pamphlets, have already made way. And then we all hold our Lives, Eſtates, and Liberty, only at his Good Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>I cannot Imagine why the Parliament does not take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of theſe ſort of Pretenders to Politicks, who would make them all abſolute Slaves, under the Arbitrary and Deſpotick Power of a Conqueror!</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:65103:37"/>
            <p>You ſay in the ſame place (p. 7.) That <hi>the Principle of Rights of Hereditary Kings to their Crowns, being Sacred and Inviolable is Dangerous to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate, becauſe it lays a Neceſſity upon the Conqueror, to take away his Life (if he can) as well as his Throne, ſince he cannot loſe his Throne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſing of his Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) is the very Reaſon which Fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned K. <hi>James</hi> away, for he Obſerved in his <hi>Father</hi>'s Words, that <hi>there are but few Steps 'twixt a Prince</hi>'s Priſon <hi>and this</hi> Grave. And tho' ſome Kings have been ſuffered to Live ſome time in Priſon, as <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> &amp;c. Yet it ſtill ended in their Murther. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore K. <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> had no mind to ſtay any longer in Priſon, leaſt he might have made another of the Number.</p>
            <p>But it often falls out, that the Murther of one, will not Secure the Uſurpers Title: And therefore <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> Murther'd all he could get, who ſtood 'twixt him and the Crown; as did <hi>Athaliah, O. P.</hi> &amp;c. And there are many Examples of the like in Hiſtory: And theſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> do think, that this Conſideration ſhould rather Operate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch Bloody Attempts (which cannot ſtop in one or two ſingle Murthers, but Run often to the Deſtruction of whole <hi>Families,</hi> and even <hi>Nations</hi>) rather than againſt the Right of Succeſſion, in Hereditary Princes: The Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which would have ſtopt theſe Oceans of Blood, which have Drown'd many Great and Wealthy Nations, for their Violating of this <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Inviolable</hi> Right.</p>
            <p>But you ſay, Sir (p. 8.) That if this be ſo, <hi>Princes have no Remedy againſt the Injury of Neighbour Princes — for it is only the fear of Conqueſt, and loſing their Crowns, that can keep Princes in Awe, and bring them to Just and Equal Terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, is too great a Reflection upon <hi>Kings,</hi> as if there were ne're a Juſt King in the World: And your putting it in theſe General Terms, without an Exception, they ſay, Diſcovers you to be no Friend to <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65103:38"/>
            <p>But even as to the Argument. Have Princes no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt the Injury of their Neighbour Princes, but tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Crowns from them? Does every Injury deſerve ſo great a Reparation? When a King Grants Letters of Mart, is not that ſome Remedy, ſhort of Dethroning his Neighbour Prince who has Injur'd him? If I owe you a Penny, it is Juſt to take a Thouſand Pounds for it?</p>
            <p>It will be Convenient, Sir, to Explain this a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Page. 9. You ſhew the Neceſſity of Swearing to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, becauſe the whole Nation cannot Run away.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. If the whole Nation were againſt him, there wou'd be no need of this Queſtion in our Caſe: And for particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, you know the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> Refus'd to Swear to <hi>Oliver,</hi> or the <hi>Rump.</hi> And yet, tho Perſecuted, they were not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>No Conqueror will think it his Intereſt to Imbroyl his new Acquiſition, by falling upon a Great part of the People, to Drive them to Arms: And if the Diſſenters be but a ſmall part of the People, than your Objection Ceaſes; it is not the Caſe of a <hi>Whole Nation,</hi> nor the <hi>Major Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> do likewiſe Quarrel much at your Argument, p. 14. That K. <hi>James</hi> would uſe the <hi>Non-ſwearers</hi> ill, becauſe the <hi>French King</hi> uſed the <hi>Hugonots</hi> ill.</p>
            <p>They ſay, there is no Conſequence. They ſay, there is a vaſt Difference 'twixt K. <hi>James</hi>'s Character, and that which goes with ſome Men of the <hi>French King:</hi> The one a Mild and Merciful Man in his own Nature, the other as ſome would make you believe, of a more Fierce and Cruel Temper.</p>
            <p>But that which is a Greater Security, is the Diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are <hi>Two Hundred</hi> to <hi>One Papist</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> The <hi>Hugonots</hi> are not (as ſome Compute) <hi>One</hi> to <hi>a Hundred Papiſts</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, tho' there might be Reaſons for Deſtroying, or Baniſhing <hi>Two</hi> Men for the Safety or Peace of <hi>Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:65103:38"/> yet (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) the Argument will not hold to Deſtroy <hi>Two Hundred</hi> for the ſake of <hi>Two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But laſtly, they ſay, The Difference is Great, 'twixt the <hi>Non-Swearers</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> as to the Principles of <hi>Loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For tho' the <hi>Hugonots</hi> ſtuck to this K. <hi>Lewis,</hi> againſt the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> Yet this was no Religious Quarrel. Both theſe Princes were <hi>Roman Catholicks:</hi> And ſo they had not the Byaſs of <hi>Religion</hi> on either ſide.</p>
            <p>But it cannot be deny'd that they have often <hi>Rebell'd,</hi> and made many Dangerous Commotions in <hi>France</hi> of Old.</p>
            <p>And we know it was ſaid (how true I cannot tell) that the <hi>French</hi> King had Diſcovered Plots and Combinations amongſt them, even in Favour of the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi> ſo long a go, which was the Reaſon of that Perſecution, for which he is ſo much Blam'd.</p>
            <p>Whether there be any Truth in this or not, yet it is rendered the leſs Improbable; becauſe of our mighty Braggs, that the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and <hi>Hugonot Converts</hi> are in League with us, have Invited us over, and are ready to Joyn us, upon our <hi>Deſcent,</hi> for whom we carry Armes, and Depend upon them to Riſe with us, and Declare for King <hi>William,</hi> as ſoon as he is Able to Protect them.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer to <hi>Great Britains Juſt Complaint</hi> acknowledges Frankly, p. 47. in theſe Words. <hi>The French King knows, that if he be Invaded by a</hi> Proteſtant Prince, <hi>theſe Men will Endanger him by a</hi> Revolt.</p>
            <p>How far this will Juſtify the <hi>French</hi> King, in deſiring to be Rid of theſe Men, we need not Diſpute. But I could wiſh that you had not Mentioned that Matter at this time. For there is none but muſt ſee, that their Caſe is <hi>toto Colo,</hi> different from that of our <hi>Non-Swearers,</hi> who ſuffer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly for a Principle of <hi>Loyalty:</hi> And they for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Your 15th. Page, moves the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Spleen very much. You are there Bemoaning your ſelf, <hi>What would become of the Church of</hi> England <hi>if K.</hi> James <hi>ſhould Return?</hi> By which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65103:39"/> (ſay they) you only mean your ſelves, the <hi>Swearing-Clergy.</hi> Now, they ſay, that you cannot be Ignorant, that the <hi>Non-Swearers</hi> do think themſelves the True Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the others, though more Numerous, to be the <hi>Deſerters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O but ſay you, in the Name of the <hi>Swearing-Clergy,</hi> they would, it may be, Hang us in that Day, and poſſibly Exchange <hi>Smithfield</hi> for <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, is only a twinge of an akeing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And they wiſh much rather, that you ſhould live to Repent, like <hi>Peter,</hi> who <hi>Denyed</hi> his <hi>Master,</hi> out of <hi>Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that <hi>Grace</hi> was not given to <hi>Judas,</hi> who <hi>Betray'd</hi> Him out of <hi>Covetouſneſs:</hi> And he was Delivered over to the moſt Terrible Executioner, the <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Confuſion</hi> of his <hi>own Guilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why do they fear the Cruelty of the <hi>Non-Swearers?</hi> They are Generally Mild, and ſhew Signs of Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enough. They who are ſo much for <hi>Paſſive-Obedience,</hi> and practiſe it, are thereby in a Good Preparation of mind, towards Chriſtian <hi>Humility, Reſignation</hi> of themſelves to God, <hi>Forgiveneſs,</hi> and even <hi>Loving</hi> of their <hi>Enemies:</hi> And till they do ſomething Contrary to this, they think we ought, in Charity, to put the beſt Conſtruction upon their Actions.</p>
            <p>But you Diſcover what it is which Frightens the <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Clergy;</hi> and makes them ſo Apprehenſive of Revenge from the <hi>Non-Swearers.</hi> And that is, the hard Words they Receive from ſome of them. <hi>They call us no better</hi> (ſay you, p. 15.) <hi>than Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks, and Perjur'd Apoſtates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas! Did they do it! 'Tis a very hard Caſe! But (ſay the <hi>Non-Swearers</hi>) What would you have us Call you? Either, <hi>You</hi> or <hi>We</hi> are <hi>Schimaticks,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtates</hi> from the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as formerly Profeſſed in the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And would you have us to take the Blame off You, to lay it upon our Selves? And if we believe you to be <hi>Perjur'd,</hi> and would Reprove you for it, in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Method, What ſhall we call <hi>Perjury,</hi> but <hi>Perjury?</hi> If
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65103:39"/> you will tell us a more Gentile Word, you ſhall be Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with it.</p>
            <p>But you ſay in the ſame Page, <hi>They</hi> (the Non-Swearing Clergy) <hi>ſeem to Comfort themſelves under their preſent Sufferings, more with the ſweet hopes of Revenge, than any great expectations of future Rewards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) ſo very Charitable a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the <hi>Swearers.</hi> By this you free them from <hi>Convetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and making <hi>Intereſt</hi> the Guide of their <hi>Conſcience;</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you think they cannot want a little <hi>Sweet Revenge:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Provocations have been Great; and you would think it very Pallatable if their Caſe were yours.</p>
            <p>But, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> if they be afraid of an after Reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they ſhould be have with greater Moderation now: And not Hunt us with Meſſengers and Proclamations, if we Print a Word in our own Vindication, at the ſame time, that they are Provoking us to tell our Scruples openly, and that they will Anſwer fairly, and take no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>Among other Examples of Cruelty in this Sort, they In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Caſe of a Young Lad of 12 Years of Age, <hi>Thom. Roſs,</hi> his Mother a Widdow, and Lives upon Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This Orphan was found with a Paper in Defence of <hi>Paſſive Obedience;</hi> it was Doctor <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s Letter to Lord <hi>Ruffel,</hi> and the <hi>Trimming Court Divine:</hi> And becauſe he would not tell, or may be could not, where he had them, he was, without any Tryal at Law, or Jury charg'd with him, firſt ſet in the Pillory, and then Fin'd a <hi>Hundred</hi> Mark; which his Mother not being able to Pay, he has Lain now <hi>Two</hi> Years in <hi>Nemgate,</hi> and is there ſtill, and no Applications have Prevail'd, tho' his Poor Mother offer'd Part of the Fine, that is, all ſhe had in the World for his Releaſe. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Fines was once a Complaint.</p>
            <p>Of which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſhew another Inſtance in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>George Sheals</hi> a Clergy-Man, who will not <hi>Swear,</hi> but Read the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in his own Houſe, and did not Deny ſome Devour People who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times came thither, the benefit of Joyning in the Common-Prayers of the Church. For which Fault alone, he was Fin'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65103:40"/> a <hi>Hundred</hi> Marks, which being much above his preſent Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (for he is Depriv'd, and has nothing where-withal to Subſiſt a Wife and Parcel of Young Children) he Lay <hi>Three</hi> Monthes in <hi>Newgate</hi> for his Fine. Add to this the Impriſonment of Arch-Deacon <hi>Fitz Gerrald,</hi> Mr. <hi>Collier,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Newton, Three Non-Swearing</hi> Clergy-Men, this laſt Summer, without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to lay to their Charge. And Dr. <hi>Bryand</hi> Sent to the <hi>Gate-Houſe</hi> for Reading the Common Prayers, The ſeveral Lords and Gentlemen Committed without any Information upon Oath, contrary to Law, has been brought before the Parliament. Many more Inſtances the <hi>Jacobites</hi> offer to give of the like Uſage from us; and they deſire a Liſt of all whom we have Pardon'd ſince the Revolution, who have come under the Laſh of the Law, to teach them by our Mercy, to return our Kindneſs.</p>
            <p>They likewiſe mind us, That the Refuſal of the Oaths was not at firſt thought ſo Heinous a Matter, but that the Parliament Allowed <hi>Twelve</hi> of the Clergy who ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſe it, the <hi>Third</hi> of their Biſhop-ricks or Livings, during Life; and it was left to K. <hi>William</hi>'s Clemency, to Name which <hi>Twelve</hi> of the Depriv'd Biſhops or Clergy he Pleas'd.</p>
            <p>But he was Pleas'd with none of them: And their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors (whom the <hi>Jacobites</hi> call <hi>Intruders</hi>) follow, ſay they, the Example of his Charity, and keep all they can get to themſelves.</p>
            <p>They (the No-Swearers) <hi>hope to Live</hi> (ſay you <hi>ibid.</hi>) <hi>to ſee the</hi> Swearing Biſhops and Prieſts, <hi>the Contempt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This does not ſhew, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> that they are Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Life. For they may ſee that every Day they go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Streets. The Turne of the Clergy this Revolution, has made them in a Literal Sence, the <hi>By-word of the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O but their great Grief is, That if we had a <hi>Jacobite</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>they would make no Scruple to Declare the Legitimacy of the Prince of</hi> Wales p. 18.</p>
            <p>That need not, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> for he is Legitimate, by all the Laws in the World, without their Declaration, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65103:40"/> you think that <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> Fooliſh Ballads, and Drunken Songs, Laught at now by thoſe who made them (for they have ſerv'd the Turn for which they were intended) can Disinherit a Prince or any other Man of his Birth-Right: For there is no other Evidence againſt the P. of <hi>Wales,</hi> no one Information of any Perſon whatſoever, no Sentence of any Court, nor has even the preſent Parliament ſaid one Word againſt his Legitimacy.</p>
            <p>There is a Terrible Diſcovery in the Words following, <hi>viz. They would take care for new</hi> Jacobite <hi>Teſts, to Renounce and Abhor all the ſeveral Hypotheſes and Principles of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which have been <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rg'd to Justify our Submiſſion and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to their preſent Majeſties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> are a Cruel ſort of People! It is Ten to One, but they might do all this. And then we muſt be ſaying and un-ſaying all over again. But they who have done it <hi>twice</hi> or <hi>thrice,</hi> will find it eaſier and eaſier; they will never want Diſtinctions. And Shame is over —</p>
            <p>But beſides the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay it is impoſſible for them to Reproach you, more than you do one another. Even the chief Top-Men of your Party. For Example. When K. <hi>James</hi> loſt the <hi>Boyn,</hi> then Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> thought it would never be Day. He Immediately cry'd up. <hi>Succeſs</hi> as <hi>Divine Right.</hi> And upon that Point he Staked down his Soul to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and all theirs who would be perſwaded by him <hi>Vide</hi> Dedication to his Book of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and of <hi>Death.</hi> 'Twixt theſe two, he only found Converſion.</p>
            <p>But ſince that the Whore <hi>Succeſs</hi> has been Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Handſom Portly <hi>French</hi> King, Waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him at <hi>Mons, Namure, Steenkirk,</hi> the <hi>Rhine, Savoy, Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muyd</hi> and <hi>Furnes,</hi> and we know not where it will End.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is good to look about, and Damn that Doctrine of <hi>Succeſs</hi> in time, before it be made uſe of againſt us.</p>
            <p>For this Great Work <hi>Tillotſon</hi> is ſet up, to pull down what <hi>Sherlock</hi> had ſo Artificially built.</p>
            <p>And he does it Effectually (but not with ſo great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his old Friend) in his Thanks giving Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quoted. p. 30. where he tells us; that <hi>The Cauſe muſt be firſt Manifetly Jaſt, before Succeſs can be made an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65103:41"/> of GOD's Favour to it, and Approbation of it — Meer Succeſs is certainly one of the worſt Arguments in the World of a Good Cauſe, and the moſt Improper to Satisfy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience — And yet does in a very Odd, but Effectual way, ſatisfy the Conſciences of a Great many Men, by ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wing them their Intereſt.</hi> And p. 17. <hi>Knowledge and Skill to Deviſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and Power to Effect it, are the true Nature and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Devil and his Angels.</hi> What <hi>Jacobite</hi> could have Damn'd the Doctrine of <hi>Events</hi> more Effectually!</p>
            <p>And when they ſee ſuch Great Doctors fall out among themſelves, in the Method of Satisfying their Conſciences, as to this Revolution, it is a mighty Scandal to them, and a Tentation to think, that having forſaken their old Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are yet to ſeek where to ſettle upon true or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meer Succeſs,</hi> ſays <hi>Sherlock,</hi> is <hi>Divine,</hi> ſays <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> it is <hi>the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And each Ventures his Soul upon the Truth of his Hypotheſis, becauſe an Error in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves them in <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which both of them do Confeſs to be a Damnable Sin.</p>
            <p>But as to this Principle of Doctor <hi>Tillotſon</hi>'s, I muſt tell you, that the <hi>Jacobites</hi> are very well pleas'd with it, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the cauſe must be firſt Manifeſtly Juſt, before Succeſs can be made an Argument of GOD's Favour to it, or Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they hope now to come ſoon to a Good Concluſion, the Caſe being thus Stated upon its True Bottom; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt ſuppoſe that it was Manifeſtly Juſt, to Plot againſt K. <hi>James,</hi> while he was upon the Throne, and to aſſiſt the P. of <hi>Orange</hi> againſt him, otherwiſe the <hi>Succeſs</hi> of this Revolution <hi>can be made no Argument of GOD</hi>'s <hi>Favour to it, or Approbation of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Great Terror before us was <hi>Popery,</hi> and the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular pretence for what we have done, was Securing <hi>the Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whether <hi>Religion</hi> be a Manifeſtly Juſt Cauſe for tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms againſt our Natural Prince, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay is as Manifeſtly Decided, as any principle of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or any Act of Parliament in our Statute Book.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:65103:41"/>
            <p>They ſay moreover, that this ſame Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> her gone a length in this, beyond whatever the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> own'd in her higheſt Altitude of <hi>Paſſive-Obedience:</hi> Which is, to make it Unlawful, even to Preach the Goſpel, without leave of the Civil-Magiſtrate, unleſs we can prove our Miſſion by Miracles, as the Apoſtles did. This you will find in his Sermon upon <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. §. 2. p. 11. Preached before K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. at <hi>White-Hull</hi> 2. <hi>April,</hi> 1680.</p>
            <p>And that this Doctrine might be thorowly Inſtill'd and Propagated, he Inſtructed the Houſe of Commons in a Strain even beyond this, in his Sermon, Preached before them, 5. <hi>Nov.</hi> 1678. upon <hi>Luke</hi> 9.55,56. where he Inferrs that Religion is good for nothing but Temporal Reſpects, and that chiefly to prevent <hi>Rebellion:</hi> And that <hi>Rebellion</hi> is worſe than <hi>Atheiſm</hi> or <hi>Infidelity.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">For, let any Man (<hi>ſays he,</hi> p. 20.) ſay worſe of Atheiſm and Infidelity if he can. And for God's Sake, <hi>What is Religion Good for,</hi> but to Reform the Manners and Diſpoſitions of Men, to Reſtrain Humane Nature from Violence and Cruelty, from Falſehood and Treachery, from <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Rebellion?</hi> Better it were, there were no <hi>Reveal'd</hi> Religion — than to be Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Religion that — is continually Supplanting Government — Teaching the Lawfulneſs of Depoſing Kings — Such a Religion as this, is as bad, or worſe than Infidelity and no Religion, p. 21.</q> and a Great deal more to the ſame purpoſe, which makes it more Eligible to Renounce <hi>Christ,</hi> and all <hi>Reveal'd</hi> Religion, than to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the Lawfulneſs of taking Armes againſt our King, upon the Account of Religion.</p>
            <p>I hope he will think it worth his while to Explain theſe Matters for the ſake of others, as well as the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> for in Truth, Sir, they carry a very ſtrange Aſpect, and Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble very Well-Meaning Men. Together with his Letter to Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and Prayer on the Scaffold with his Lordſhip. which are ſo Notorious, I need not Repeat them. As likewiſe theſe Paſſages in Doctor <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Sermon, upon the Diſcovery of the <hi>Phanatick</hi> and <hi>Republican</hi> Plot at <hi>Rye-Houſe.</hi> Printed <hi>Anno.</hi> 1683.</p>

            <p>Where, after Diſproving the pretence of Rebelling for <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> he proceeds to the Grand pretence of <hi>Religion.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The Libertyes and Propertys of the Subject</hi> (ſays he p. 2.) <hi>is an Admirable Pretence to Deprive the Prince of his Libertys and Propertyes; and thoſe who have any Liberty or Property to looſe, ſeldom gain any thing by this: For when you have ſecur'd their Liberties and Properties against their Prince, it is a much harder Task, to ſecure themſelves from their Fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> But let us hear him as to <hi>Religion.</hi>

               <p>And thus the poor <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which has eſcap'd the Rage and Fury of <hi>Rome,</hi> had like to have been Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to a <hi>True Proteſtant</hi> Zeal — How things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded after this, to the Diſturbance of the publick Peace, and the Interruption of the Ordinary Courts of Juſtice, you all know as well as I; and Wiſe Men quickly Saw, and Honeſt Men could not forbear Warning the People, whither thoſe things Tended: And they met with a good Reward for it; they were all <hi>Papists</hi> in Maſquerade, and eſpecially, the <hi>Loyal Clergy</hi> were Loaded with all the Contempt and Ignominy, which an Inrag'd and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65103:42"/> Envenom'd Zeal, and ſome Witleſs Scriblers could caſt on them. Whole Vollies of Phamplets flew about, to poiſon the people, with Lewd and Seditious principles: But to Talk, or Write, or Preach about <hi>Obedience to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or patient Suffering for a Good Cauſe, was to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the <hi>Proteſtant Interest,</hi> and to Invite a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to Cut our Throats: And what all this ends in, thanks be to God, we now ſee, and I hope, time enough to prevent it.</p>

            <p>And thus he proves it to be in the preſent Caſe, in the Words immediately following, <hi>viz.

Letter p. 26.</p>
            <p>And now the proof is. That it is <hi>Glaringly</hi> Evident to <hi>all the World.</hi> This (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) the Dr. meant for a Joque, for he) knows <hi>all the World</hi> is not of his Mind. And a <hi>Glaring</hi> Light is the falſeſt Light can be, it Strikes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65103:44"/> one Blind.

            <p>It was this (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) <hi>Glared</hi> in his Eyes, that he could not ſee, what the Pooreſt Dablers in Divinity have at their Fingers ends, and it is one of the firſt Principles Taught among the <hi>Caſuiſts, viz.</hi> That not only <hi>the Cauſe</hi> muſt be Good, but the <hi>Means.</hi> That a <hi>Good Cauſe</hi> will not Juſtify <hi>Wicked Means.</hi> That we muſt not Lye for GOD, that their Damnation is <hi>Just,</hi> who do <hi>Evil,</hi> that <hi>Good</hi> may come of it. Therefore, there was ſomething more to be ſaid, beſides <hi>the Cauſe</hi> being <hi>True Religion,</hi> which is all the Doctor Urges.</p>
            <p>We know that all <hi>Pretences</hi> are <hi>Good:</hi> For if a thing were not <hi>Good,</hi> it could not be a <hi>Pretence.</hi> No Man <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends</hi> to do <hi>Wickedly.</hi> And the better the thing is, it makes the better <hi>Pretence;</hi> therefore, <hi>Religion</hi> is the General <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> for <hi>Rebellion.</hi> But, as before is ſaid, <hi>Religion</hi> muſt not be ſerv'd by <hi>Means,</hi> which that <hi>Religion</hi> does forbid; that would be to Deſtroy <hi>Religion,</hi> to pleaſe GOD by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His Commandments; to take Service with the <hi>Beelze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hub,</hi> for the Cauſe of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>We have no Diſpute with the <hi>Proteſtant Jacobites,</hi> but concerning the <hi>Means</hi> of Preſerving our <hi>Religion:</hi> They ſay, the <hi>Means</hi> we take are not Juſtifyable: And for you; Sir, to ſay nothing at all to this, but that it is <hi>Glaring!</hi> The <hi>Jacobites</hi> think, was becauſe your Underſtanding was <hi>Dazled;</hi> and they take it as a Yielding of the Cauſe.</p>

And he ſays all this of <hi>Popery,</hi> only upon the Account of its containing the Doctrine of <hi>Reſiſtance.</hi> But he makes a Notable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, p. 24. Where he tells us. <q rend="inline">That many have all along held and believ'd theſe Doctrines of <hi>Depoſing Kings, and of Abſolving their Subjects from Obedience to them,</hi> and have frequently put them in Execution, though they have not thought it ſo Convenient at all Turns, to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it.

               <hi>Theſe are the Doctor's own Words.</hi> And the <hi>Jacobites</hi> leave the Application to himſelf: And hope they need not fear now that he has got the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword. Let him take care to whom he Lends it. All the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> (but thoſe of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) are Sueing for it. The <hi>Socinians</hi> want not hopes that it will come to their Turn at laſt.</p>
            <p>But if another Turn come firſt, then, ſays your Letter to a Friend, p. 19. <hi>Thoſe who in the Late Reign were the Great Advocates of the Proteſtant Cauſe, will be Diſgrac'd at Court, Threatned into ſilence, their Authority Weakned, and their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Reproac'd, both by</hi> Papiſts <hi>and</hi> Jacobites.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> Gueſs who are Meant by this; and ſay, that thoſe who were Advocates for the <hi>Protestant Cauſe</hi> in the Late Reign, and Preach'd down the <hi>Depoſing Doctrine,</hi> as <hi>a Mark of the Beaſt,</hi> and ſhall come about in this Reign, and own Publickly that they were Miſtaken, and both Preach and Practiſe now bare-Fac'd, that ſame <hi>Popery</hi> they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65103:45"/> Damn'd before, deſerve not the Name of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but <hi>Apoſtates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the Contrary, thoſe who adhere conſtantly to their Principles, which they profeſt before this Turne do preſerve their Authority and Reſpect, in the midſt of the Reproaches of thoſe who are Griev'd, that they Live to be a Reproach to them. And, if they ſhould not find Sutable Rewards for their Conſtancy in this World, it is laid up for them in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> give us Inſtances, where the <hi>Depriv'd</hi> do Force Witneſs and Atteſtation, even from their <hi>Deprivers,</hi> who ſomtimes forget themſelves, to Comdemn what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have done. Which brought an Old <hi>Sier,</hi> as the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites</hi> do certainly Aſſure us; to beg My Lord of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s Bleſſing, and therein his <hi>Pardon,</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> Day after he had lay'd his Hands upon the Intruder into his Throne. But the Arch-Biſhop ſtop'd his Lord-ſhip, as he was Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ask'd him, if he had forgot what he had been doing on <hi>Sunday?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the following Pages 20. 21. you ſhew the Miſeries of a <hi>Civil-War,</hi> which you ſay muſt follow, if the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſhould Aſſiſt K. <hi>James;</hi> for that K. <hi>William will not Deſert nor Abdicate:</hi> And you are reſolv'd to Aſſiſt him againſt K. <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> Laugh at this Argument. It is like the Old Saying. <hi>The ſecond Blow makes the Quarrel.</hi> I Turn you out of your Houſe, and deſire you to make no Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance about it, becauſe I am Reſolv'd not to part with it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, That if we will not Aſſiſt K. <hi>William,</hi> but let K. <hi>James</hi> Deal with him and his <hi>Forreign</hi> Troops, we ſhall have very little <hi>Civil-War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now which of us is in the Right or the Wrong, muſt depend upon the Juſtice of the Cauſe. And that is the Iſſue to which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> alwaies Preſs to bring us.</p>
            <p>But Indeed, Sir, you have given a very unlucky Inſtance, p. 20. where Aggravating the Miſeries of a <hi>Civil-War,</hi> you bid us look into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſee to <hi>what a Heap of Rubbiſh
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65103:45"/> a Flouriſhing and Fruitful Country is Reduc'd, by being the Scene of a three Years War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Jacobites</hi> deſire us to take a Specimen of the Advantage of a <hi>Civil-War</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> to Defend our Rights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when that Country could not have Suffered ſo much in the Reign of Twenty Tyrants, as by that Short <hi>Civil-War</hi> of Three Years. They deſire us then to think of the Conſequences of Entailing many Years <hi>Civil-War</hi> (for ought we know) upon theſe Nations: <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter</hi> laſted a Hundred Years, and this War (in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability) will not ceaſe while K. <hi>James</hi> or the P. of <hi>Wales,</hi> or any of their Iſſue ſtand nearer to the Crown, than the preſent Poſſeſſors: Which may be till <hi>England</hi> be Reduc'd to a Heap of Rubbiſh like <hi>Ireland.</hi> Therefore they deſire and requeſt, that we would Conſider in time, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of <hi>England,</hi> and the Peace of our Selves, and our Poſteritys, before it be too late. And not to Flatter our Selves; into our own Ruin, by the Notion of our Draining <hi>France,</hi> in the Lengthing out of this War, for we have try'd Three Campaigns, and find it is not to be done ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, by Force, unleſs <hi>Lewis</hi> would lend us ſome of his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals;</hi> It being ſaid Publickly in the Houſe of Commons, that <hi>England</hi> had not a Man fit to make a General of Horſe: I think we muſt have a little of his <hi>Mony</hi> too for he is not half Drain'd ſo Low as we are; nor has this War made him ſuch Miſerable Subjects, no not in <hi>Dauphiny,</hi> ſo Poor, ſo Harraſs'd, ſo Ruin'd as they are in <hi>Ireland, almoſt</hi> (ſays Lord <hi>Sidney</hi> in his Speech to the Parliament there, 5. <hi>Octob.</hi> 92.) <hi>to an utter Deſolation of the Country.</hi> And yet he tells them, <hi>That the Neceſſity of his Maſters Affairs, Compels him to Ask a Supply from them, at a time, when the Kingdom is in ſo Low a Condition, and hath Suffer'd ſo much in the War.</hi> On the other Hand <hi>Grand-Lewis,</hi> has (as the very <hi>Dutch</hi> News tells us) not only freed <hi>Dauphiny</hi> from all ſort of Taxes for Ten Years to come; but ſent them Great Quantities of Corn, and other Supplys, that his Subjects may not feel the War, which he has carry'd on to this Day, without Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing one Tax upon his People: For he has ſound a way to make War at his Enemys Coſt, and cauſe them to bear

There came a Liſt into Parliament of more than <hi>Thirty</hi> Men of War, taken by the <hi>French,</hi> and otherwiſe Loſt by ſeveral Accidents, and <hi>Eight</hi> Diſabl'd ſince the Year 88. and the Liſt is well Increas'd ſince that time. To Ballance all this, the <hi>French</hi> had one unlucky Accident at Sea laſt <hi>May,</hi> 92. Whereby they loſt the Hulks of <hi>Sixteen</hi> Ships, the Guns and Rigging Sav'd, but not one Sunk or Taken in Fight, tho' we were twice their Number: And I muſt tell you, that the <hi>Jacobites</hi> think us Horrible Ridiculous, even to Madneſs, and that it muſt appear ſo to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to ſee us ſo Tranſported with this, as to Equal it to the Miraculous Deliverance of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh, &amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> as you have heard from Dr. <hi>Sherlock:</hi> But that his Predeceſſor in <hi>Paul</hi>'s, has learnt to <hi>Cant</hi> as far beyond him, as he has got in Dignity before him. In his Thanks-giving-Sermon, 27. <hi>Octob.</hi> 92. p. 25. He ſays it was <hi>The Greatest and Cheapest</hi> (Sea Victory) <hi>that ever the Sun ſaw, from his firſt Setting out to Run his Courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, they can Forgive in him for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Reaſons: And becauſe he makes an Humble Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for it in the ſame Sermon, p. 8. in theſe Words, <hi>viz. The Exceſs of Knowledge and Wiſdom — if attended with Pride — is very Dangerous, and does many times Border up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Distraction, and Run into Madneſs.</hi> For Example. p. 33. He Flatters K. <hi>William</hi> to his Face, even to <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> giving as High a Character of him, as could be ſaid of CHRIST
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65103:46"/> Himſelf, with Relation to His Humane Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> That he does <hi>Imitute the Divine Perfections, as far as the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Humanel Nature, in this Morral State, will Admit.</hi> And yet in the ſame Breath, p. 34. (he ſays) <hi>It is Beneath an Honeſt and a Generous Mind to Flatter,</hi> p. 31. He Rejoyces mightily at a New Diſcovery he has made, That the Weeping and Wailing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.17. was Meant of the <hi>French</hi> this Sea-Fight, and, ſays he, did <hi>little Imagine this Thirty Years ago.</hi> But the Lamentations Mention'd in that Text, are plainly of the <hi>Merchants,</hi> for their Great Loſſes at Sea, and Decay of Trade: And where that will Light. I believe he did as little Imagine.</p>
            <p>All this the <hi>Jacobites</hi> can eaſily paſs by, as ſome of the <hi>Bold Strokes,</hi> which this Doctor thinks his particular Talent.</p>
            <p>But they are Amazed to ſee this Spirit of Infatuation, Poſſeſs the Body of our Repreſentatives in Parliament, in the Addreſs of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> to their Queen, 10. <hi>Nov.</hi> 92. Where they call this ſuch a <hi>Glorious and Compleat Victory, as is not to be Equal'd in any former Age, and can never be forgotten by Poſterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> think theſe Gentlemen deſerve an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; ſuppoſing they ought to know more than other men; for if there is no more in it, than what is viſible to the World; The <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, That this is the moſt ſurprizing and unaccountable Madneſs, ever ſeiz'd the Brains of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or (to follow the <hi>Cant</hi>) that <hi>Ever the Sun ſaw, from his firſt ſetting out to run his Courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, in Pitty to the Weakneſs of theſe Blind <hi>Jacobites,</hi> I beſeech you, Sir, to Explain a little, wherein the <hi>Miracle</hi> of this <hi>Victory</hi> does Conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Was it ſo Great a Miracle, for a <hi>Hundred.</hi> Sail of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> to Worſt <hi>Forty French?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had it not been a <hi>Greater Miracle,</hi> if they had not Beaten the <hi>French</hi> with ſuch odds? Was it not a <hi>Miracle</hi> they had not a Greater Victory over them? That they cou'd neither Burn, Sink, nor Take one of their Ships in <hi>Three</hi> Days Fight?</p>
            <pb n="88" facs="tcp:65103:47"/>
            <p>That the <hi>French</hi> were able to Maintain ſo unequal a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, with ſo much Advantage, that if they had had any Ports, or but an Hours more Tyde, they had left us with the Greateſt Share of the Loſs? Why was Sir <hi>John Aſhby,</hi> and other of our Admirals, queſtion'd in <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the ill Conduct of this Fight? Wou'd you have had more than the Greateſt and Cheapeſt Victory ever the Sun ſaw?</p>
            <p>Was it not a much greater Victory, when the <hi>French</hi> Beat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets, <hi>with Equal Number,</hi> in the Year 90. And Poſſeſs'd our Shore Triumphant, a whole Month together?</p>
            <p>Had we been able to have forc'd our way into St. <hi>Malo</hi>'s, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> did into <hi>Chattam!</hi> Cou'd we have brought off but one of their Ships, for <hi>Memory</hi> of our <hi>Victory,</hi> tho' we had turn'd it, after, into a Place of Entertainment (like the <hi>Folly</hi> upon the <hi>Thames</hi>) as the <hi>Dutch</hi> have done with our <hi>Royal-Charles,</hi> taken from <hi>Chattam!</hi> Had we met the <hi>French</hi> with Equal Number; had we blown their Admiral into the Air, as the Duke of <hi>York</hi> did <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That he not only Refus'd to Confirm the Magiſtrates at <hi>Torgoes,</hi> according, as they ſay, to the Cuſtome, as being Stadt-Holder: But he would have the Election wholly to himſelf: And accordingly he Rejected the Magiſtrates Choſen by the City, and Appointed others in their Places.

That he ſent Dragoons and others, of Greater Number than uſual, to Quarter upon them, and Reduee them to Obedience, that they ſhut their Gates, and Refus'd to Receive ſuch a Number of Soldiers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon more were ſent, and ſomething fram'd like a Siege. That the Town was at length forc'd to Submit.

            <p>The whole Province of <hi>Zealand</hi> was Miarm'd at the Sentence againſt the Preſident Burgo-Maſter of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes</hi> and his Brethron, and the Inhabitants of the City came Weeping about him, as if they were going to loſe their Father, and the only Defender of their Liberties and Priviledges.

The Stadt-Holder having Notice, from ſeveral Parts, of the Great Diſcontents in <hi>Zealand,</hi> occaſion'd by the foreſaid Sentence, and being Apprehenſive of the Miſchiefs which might Enſue, ſhould it be Executed, ſent him his Pardon, to prevent an Inſurrection, which in Great Probability, would have been occaſioned thereby.

               </p>
            </q>
            <p>There is another Occurrence, which they tell of the <hi>Geneva Clergy,</hi> that is very like our Preſent Debate here, concerning the <hi>Validity of a Lay-Deprivation, of the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Story is this, as I ſaw it from a very Good Hand in <hi>Geneva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the latter end of <hi>Septem.</hi> laſt, there was a Solemn Faſt kept at <hi>Geneva.</hi> They met at Church at <hi>Four</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and continued till <hi>Five</hi> in the Afternoon: And all this time was Spent in Singing Pſalms, Preaching, and Praying. One of the Miniſters Reflected very ſharply upon ſome Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Office, yet without Naming any one, for their Pride and Inſolence, in Challenging and Taking the Precedence before the Miniſters, in Receiving the Sacrament, contrary to the Conſtant Cuſtom of that Church, where the Miniſters alwaies Communicate after the <hi>Council of State,</hi> who are there, the Repreſentatives of the <hi>Sovereignty.</hi> The Officers Complain'd to the Council, who, Summon the Miniſter, he Appears, Declines their Authority as <hi>Incompotent,</hi> and Perſiſts in it. Upon which, the Council Pronounce <hi>Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> againſt him, During Pleaſure. And the Miniſter ſtill
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65103:49"/> Perſiſts in Denying their Authority. And thus the Matter ſtood, when the Letter was Wrote. He tells likewiſe, that he once heard <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> Aſſerted in their Pulpits, as the Peculiar Character of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> but that, in other things, the Spirit of <hi>Calvin</hi> ſtill prevails: That they all Condemn the <hi>Sectarys</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and not one of them thinks the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, he ſays, he has heard them commend our <hi>Common-Prayer:</hi> And one of them Diſcourſing to him of the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in <hi>England,</hi> ſaid, he knew not how to Approve or Juſtify it; and that there was more of the <hi>Cavalier,</hi> than of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>Here I had ended, having tired my ſelf, and I'm afraid you too; But a Pamphlet coming into my Hands, call'd an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Great Britains Just Complaint,</hi> which is Wrote, Sir, in Vindication of this Letter of yours, from the Objections which are againſt it in <hi>Great Britains Complaint,</hi> I thought it would be very proper to let you know, what the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> ſay againſt that Anſwer, that you may have the whole Cauſe before you, and by one Effectual Reply, may ſilence them for ever.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend to Examine all that Anſwer to <hi>Britains Complaint,</hi> I leave it to the Author to Defend himſelf, but I will only tell you ſome Curſory Obſervations I have heard from the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> upon a ſlight View <hi>En Paſſant,</hi> to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain you, till the Fuller Anſwer (which I hear is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring) ſhall Appear.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place, I muſt tell you, that theſe <hi>Jacobites</hi> are no ways Diſcourag'd, but ſhew themſelves mightily Pleas'd with the Performance of the Anſwerer to <hi>Great Britains Complaint,</hi> who Vindicates K. <hi>William,</hi> they ſay, at ſuch a Rate, as Expoſes him more than the Book he pretends to Anſwer. They ſay, he brings in (by way of Apology) the ſevereſt Objections which K. <hi>William</hi>'s Greateſt Enemys could Suggeſt; and then ſays nothing in the World to Clear them.</p>
            <p>That, it is known to every <hi>Engliſh-Man</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that K. <hi>William</hi> had no Battle in <hi>England.</hi> Therefore that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65103:50"/> it is moſt Ridiculous in this Author, p. 65. to Bragg of King <hi>William</hi>'s Victories in <hi>England,</hi> and to Advance his Proweſs for this, above that of the <hi>French</hi> K. whom he calls a <hi>Coward.</hi> Was this in his Zeal, to make <hi>England</hi> a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt?</hi> Which is the Notion of late much Advanc'd.</p>
            <p>That it would appear full as Comical to the <hi>French,</hi> to Boaſt of K. <hi>William</hi>'s Victorys in <hi>Flanders.</hi> (as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor does in the ſame Place) Would they not deſire you to Name them? Or to remember what the <hi>Dutch</hi> Narrative above-quoted Names, <hi>viz.</hi> The Battle of St. <hi>Nuef,</hi> the Siege of <hi>Maſtricht,</hi> of <hi>Woerden, Oudenard,</hi> and of <hi>Charleroy:</hi> And once at <hi>Mons,</hi> they ſay, he Attempted to Steal a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with the Articles of Peace in his Pocket.</p>
            <p>They Ridicule him, and ſay, that none but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have been Civil to him. For none elſe will be Beaten by him, and not that, but when he is much Superior in Number, as he was at the <hi>Boyn,</hi> which was the firſt time, the <hi>French</hi> ſay, that ever he ſaw himſelf a Victor, and is like to be the laſt, For the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves Baffled him afterwards at <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> and Forc'd him to Turn his Back.</p>
            <p>But this Author ſays <hi>ibid.</hi> That K. <hi>William Dar'd the French Army,</hi> and makes his Great Proweſs conſiſt in that. Whereas this is the very Jeſt which the <hi>French</hi> put upon him, <hi>viz.</hi> That he Stood at the Head of a <hi>Hundred Thouſand</hi> Men, to ſee the <hi>French King</hi> in Perſon, take <hi>Namur (amat Victoria Teſtes!)</hi> without Daring to Strike a Stroak in its Defence, tho' he came thither on purpoſe for its Reſcue. And his <hi>Daring</hi> to ſee the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Butcher'd at <hi>Stein-Kirk</hi> before his Face, without <hi>Daring</hi> to come in to their Relief, tho' he had drawn them into that Snare by his Conduct.</p>
            <p>And the Inference this Author Draws from K. <hi>William</hi>'s thus <hi>Daring</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> is in the next Words, <hi>viz. That if the</hi> French <hi>have the Advantage, yet K.</hi> William <hi>hath En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the Honour of the Campaign.</hi> Which is as ſevere a Satyr, as any of K. <hi>William</hi>'s Enemys could have made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to ſet up a <hi>Hero</hi> for his <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> Valour in War!</p>
            <q>

Upon which, this Inn-keeper ventur'd, and found them as good as their word, and brought Letters from Sir <hi>William Jenning</hi>'s, and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, on Board, having that occaſion, to ſome of their Friends: Of which this Fellow was yet ſo Cautious, that he brought them open, and delivered them to the next Juſtice of Peace.

            <p>He was Taken upon <hi>Thurſday, Janu.</hi> 1. 90/91. Try'd and Found Guilty the <hi>Saturday</hi> Fortnight after. The <hi>Thurſday</hi> before, his Father-in-Law was Employed to Drink upon him, moſt part of the Day, and at <hi>Ten</hi> a Clock at Night, he was Hurry'd away, being in Great Diſorder, to <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinton,</hi> where another Treat was Provided, and then he was brought before K. <hi>William,</hi> where he Spoke, not with that Caution, as Reaſonably may be ſuppos'd, he would have had at another time. On <hi>Friday</hi> K. <hi>William</hi> went for <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Next Day Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> was brought to his Tryal, where he was Confronted with the Lord <hi>Preſident,</hi> and Lord <hi>Sidney,</hi> who had been both Preſent at his Intercourſe with K. <hi>William,</hi> which Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> Declar'd was a Great Awe upon him, and Interruption to the Defence he had to make for himſelf, not Remembring, what he had ſaid in that Diſorder he was in at <hi>Kinſinton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he was not Releas'd till about the end of <hi>May</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. All which time, he was Delivered over to <hi>Satan,</hi> to be Buffeted, under the Conduct of his Renegado <hi>Reis-Efendi,</hi> the moſt Dexterous of that <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Executioners. It would make another Part of the <hi>Turkiſh Spy,</hi> to tell all the Arts, and little Contrivances, of this Bloody Officer to Wheedle, to Frighten, to Circumvent this Condemn'd Lord. The Sheriff being one Day ſent to give him Notice of his Execution, ſuch an Hour; another Day Viſited kindly by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65103:54"/> his Lordſhips Self, and Lord <hi>Deu.</hi> at other times, by other Emiſſaries, with New Threats, and Promiſes of Rewards, and Preferments if he would Comply; telling him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had Diſcovered againſt him, even thoſe whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to Serve, ſuffering none to come near him, to Undeceive him in any Point.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, having try'd all ways, they Reſolv'd to make him an Evidence: In order to which it was Neceſſary to Qualify him, by Cranting him a Pardon. But his Eſtate being Intayl'd, was the Greateſt Security he had for his Life; which if they took, they would loſe the Benefit of Seizing his Eſtate: Therefore, they choſe to keep that as an Awe over him, to Force him to be an Evidence: And accordingly, having paſs'd his Pardon, about the end of <hi>May,</hi> and his Lordſhip gone immediately Home to live Privately, he was ſtraight ſent for again in <hi>June,</hi> and told that he muſt be an Evidence. Which his Lordſhip poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Refuſed.</p>
            <p>That Lord <hi>Preſident</hi> bid him Remember, that tho' his <hi>Life</hi> was Pardon'd, he had an <hi>Estate</hi> to loſe. And told him, that the Parliament might Undo what the King had Done, and Revoke even the Pardon which the King had Granted. Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaid, he was Surprized to hear that Doctrine from his Lordſhip. K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. having hazarded a Breach with his Parliament, to Support the Pardon his Majeſty had Granted to his Lordſhip upon which Lord <hi>N.</hi> interpos'd, Solv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as well as he could, and then Ordered the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who attended, to let my Lord <hi>Preſton</hi> know, what was yet in the Power of the Government, to Inflict upon his Lordſhip, in Caſe of his Refuſal to be an Evidence. The Council Learned in the Law, then Declared, That they could Impriſon him, During Life, and Fine him more than he was Worth. His Lordſhip Anſwered, that he thought <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> had Limited Fines, to be <hi>Salvo Contemento:</hi> And likewiſe laid down Methods for the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Subject. However, That neither Life nor Eſtate ſhould prevail upon him, to bring Innocent Blood upon his own Head.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:65103:54"/>
            <p>His Lordſhip was thereupon ſent <hi>Twice</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> whence he Delivered himſelf both times by <hi>Habeas Corpus.</hi> And his whole Eſtate was Seized, and is ſtill, to force him to Hang his own Brother, and others whom they do not like. And he now Suffers under their Clemency and Good Nature.</p>
            <p>But how came it, that this Author did Name but <hi>One</hi> of the Pardons, Granted by K. <hi>William.</hi> For there were <hi>Two</hi> in his Reign. The other was Granted to <hi>Crone.</hi> And the Price he was to Pay for it, was to be an Evidence. But he was with Great Difficulty and Management brought to it, by the Induſtry of the foreſaid <hi>Reis-Efendi:</hi> When he made the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

At laſt his Fears prevail'd: He ſaid to ſome of his Friends, that he was too Young to Dye, conſidering his Life had not been Strickt: And they took his Informations upon Oath, after his Condemnation, and before his Pardon, while he was a Dead Man in Law: But to Qualify him to be an Evidence, they Granted him a Pardon: But leaſt he might Start back, the Pardon was given into a Third Hand, Sir <hi>John Holt,</hi> who was to be his Judge, can tell where it was Lodg'd. Upon this, he had his Liberty. And the very Day, before he was to have been Produc'd, as an Evidence againſt the Lives of Honeſt Men, he, Struck with the Terror of ſo Great a Wickedneſs, made ſhift to get out of the Reach of his Tormentors, and ſtill continues ſo. <hi>All this, Sir, the Wicked</hi> Jacobites <hi>do ſay, I Repeat their Words.

But that he, the ſaid Biſhop, <hi>Started up Immediately, and ſaid, be thought the King was too well known, for any to Dare to come with ſuch a Propoſition; he hoped, he himſelf had been alſo ſo well known, that none ſhould have made it by him, he was Sorry a Promiſe was given of Safety; but he bid the Rogue be gone immediately:</hi> And that K. <hi>William</hi> Order'd the Biſhop, <hi>to be ſure, to Seize upon him,</hi> that had made the Propoſal, <hi>if ever he could ſet Eye on him again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> wonder, if K. <hi>William,</hi> or the Biſhop, had ſo Great a Mind to find out this Man, how it came to be kept a Secret all this time: That the Biſhop, ſure, muſt know ſomething of the Man, and ſome Marks of him, with whom he had had ſuch Familiar Converſation.

            <p>But as to his Lordſhips Great Tenderneſs, and Starting at the Propoſal of Killing the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>(for which you have his own Word)</hi> the <hi>Jacobites</hi> know a Paſſage nearer Home, which is better Vouch'd, and, they ſay, does ſet the <hi>Meekneſs</hi> of that Prelate <hi>in a Clearer Light,</hi> and that is: When K. <hi>James</hi> was Seized at <hi>Feverſham,</hi> by the <hi>Mobb,</hi> Mr. <hi>Naple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> (who had been very Active in this Revolution, and was one of thoſe, who, under K. <hi>James</hi>'s Window at <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſham,</hi> Read the P. of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration, and is one of the <hi>Excepted</hi> Perſons in K. <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration) came up to <hi>London,</hi> to give an Account to the P. of <hi>Orange,</hi> of what they had Acted and Done at <hi>Feverſham.</hi> And at the Prince's Court, Meeting Dr. <hi>B—t,</hi> who ſeem'd very Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive to be Inform'd what had Paſs'd, and amongſt other things; Mr. <hi>Napleton</hi> telling him, that the <hi>Mobb</hi> were ſo Barbarouſly Rude to his Majeſty in the Houſe, to which the King was Firſt brought, that his Majeſty Reſolv'd to go to ſome other Houſe in Town, where he hop'd he might be better Secur'd, from the Barbarity of the <hi>Mobb,</hi> and called upon Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> to come along with him, and Declar'd that he would not go without him; and that, as the King was going to the Door of the Room, the <hi>Mobb</hi> very Outragiouſly lifted up their Clubbs, Staves, and what Weapons they had; and Mr. <hi>Napleton</hi> told the Doctor, that he verily believed, had not he Stopt the King from going, they would certainly have Knock'd out his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Brains.

            <p>It is ſtrange indeed, Sir, that this paſt the <hi>Imprimatur</hi> without ſome farther Explanation: Becauſe it Opens the Crying Objection, which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> have againſt Us, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in their own Words, <hi>viz.</hi> That we Diſpenſe with the <hi>Fifth</hi> Command (which none Deny to be <hi>Moral</hi>) <hi>to ſerve K.</hi> William, <hi>and Extirpate what we call</hi> Hereſie. For all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the Earth, do, even from the Light of Nature, think it an <hi>Immoral</hi> and moſt Wicked thing for <hi>Children to Riſe againſt their Parents.</hi> And have we any other Excuſe for it (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) except to Support K. <hi>William,</hi> and what we call <hi>The Protestant Religion?</hi> And does not this make <hi>That Action, which is in its Self Morally Ill, become Good?</hi> They Ask us whether <hi>Diſobedience to Parents,</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from ſuch Circumſtances as the Preſent Caſe, be not <hi>in it Self Morally Ill?</hi> And whether the Preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances do not make it <hi>become Good?</hi> And then, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not, in Terms, that Wicked <hi>Caſuiſtical Doctrine,</hi> Charged upon the <hi>Franch Court Divines,</hi> to <hi>Patronize the very Worſh of Actions,</hi> as this Author Speaks, <hi>ibid.</hi> Page. 29.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jacobites</hi> think it is not more Obſervable, which is Related of K. <hi>Charles</hi> I's taking Notice of the Properneſs of the 27. <hi>Matt.</hi> the Leſſon for the 30. <hi>Jan.</hi> to his then Circumſtances, Than that the 13. <hi>Mark.</hi> which Foretells <hi>Childrens Riſing up against their Parents,</hi> ſhould be the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the 13. <hi>Feb.</hi> on which Day K. <hi>James</hi>'s Children took Poſſeſſion of his Crown.

               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:65103:60"/> make this Uſe of it, as an Objection againſt us, that if all theſe <hi>Immoras</hi> Actions, which are <hi>Curſed</hi> from the Mouth of God, can be ſo Sanctify'd by their being intended for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as that our <hi>Engliſh Court Divines</hi> ſhould uſher <hi>K.

            <p>Among all whom, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, that Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and the <hi>Re-publican</hi> Cabal, could not find a <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> ſo well fitted as the 'foreſaid Dr. <hi>B—t,</hi> whom they choſe to State the Caſe to K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. for Divorcing his Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> in order to Defeat the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> which the Doctor did Learnedly State, and Reſolve in the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> for the good of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> which Caſe the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, they have, and perhaps, in the Dr's own Hand, to produce upon Occaſion.

            <p>The only Salvo I can find for Us, is in p. 18.

            </p>
            <p>Sir, theſe are the Things we want, and the <hi>Jacobites</hi> deſire; And I beſeech you do not ſpare them, for you ſee they do not ſpare us. Tell out the whole Truth, conceal Nothing, out of Modeſty, that may Convince, or elſe Confound them; for they are Confident, That all this is meer Vapor and Brag; and that we have no more to ſay againſt them, than we have ſaid already, and which they have Confuted, every word of it, as they pretend.</p>
            <p>Our Chief Dependence is now upon your Pen: Therefore your SILENCE will CONFIRM theſe <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and make them Inſult; will Stagger many, who are Well-inclin'd towards Us, and give up our Cauſe for this Generation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, for Ever.

            <p>This is therefore, to let the Reader know, that that part of this Diſcourſe was Printed laſt Summer.

But Excuſes ſignify nothing. You muſt take them now as they are.</p>

            <p>You have Faln more Fatally (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) by the Vindication of your ſelf, which you have Publiſhed ſince the Burning of your Pamphlet, than by what you have Suffered in Effigie in <hi>Pallace-Yard.</hi> For that you have, out of your own Mouth, given your ſelf the Lye, and Overthrown all the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations which your ſelf had ſet up, to ſupport this Change of Government, and Juſtify the Part you have Acted in it.</p>
            <p>The Defence you have made, is by Re-printing your <hi>Meaſures of Submiſſion to the Supream Authority,</hi> with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, wherein you Accuſc the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> for Judging you <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſtly, <hi>viz.</hi> without Reading or Conſidering that Book which they Condemn'd to be Burn'd, or the Principles Contain'd in it.

            <p>All this, Doctor, they Apply to you, likewiſe, as to the Birth of the P. of <hi>Wales,</hi> which, at the Cloſe of your <hi>Meaſures of Obedience,</hi> you call <hi>a Baſe Impoſture;</hi> and yet they all know, that you your ſelf often Pray'd Publickly for the P. of <hi>Wales,</hi> by Name, in the Chappel of her Royal Highneſs at the <hi>Hague,</hi> after all the Reports which you, and others ſpread abroad of that <hi>Impoſture.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Tho' the <hi>Jacobites</hi> did neither Need, nor Deſire <hi>his</hi> Help, to Overthrow your pretty Diſtinction of Conquering the <hi>King,</hi> but not the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which you Repeat, and Inſiſt upon in your <hi>Vindicatory Preface:</hi> And would Perſwade all your <hi>Clergy</hi> and their <hi>Flocks,</hi> to Pawn their Souls upon it, by taking the <hi>Oaths</hi> upon that Foundation: Which is the Theam in your <hi>Paſtoral Letter.</hi> And to which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Reply briefly thus.</p>
            <p>That if Conquering a <hi>King,</hi> gives the <hi>Conqueror</hi> a Right to that <hi>Authority</hi> which the King had, then, by Conquering the <hi>King,</hi> he Gains a Right to be <hi>King</hi> of the Conquer'd Kings's <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And it has been thus underſtood in all Hiſtorys, and Conqueſts that we Read of.</p>
            <p>And this is Really a Conquering of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering of the <hi>King,</hi> who is the <hi>Head,</hi> and therefore Implys the Conqueſt of the <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, on the other Hand, if the Conqueſt of a <hi>King,</hi> gives the Conqueror no Right to Succeed in <hi>his Authority:</hi> Then, no Argument can be Drawn from the Conqueſt of a <hi>King,</hi> for Transferring our Allegiance to the <hi>Conqueror.</hi> Which is the only <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe the Doctor intends by this Diſtinction in his <hi>Paſtoral Letter,</hi> for the Cenqueſt of the <hi>King,</hi> Cannot otherwiſe be any Reaſon, for taking an <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the <hi>Conqueror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will not Detain you any longer, with the <hi>Jacobites</hi> Argument upon this Point, they have Vindicated it in Print, to which you may have Recourſe.</p>
            <p>Have Patience with me, only to tell one Circumſtance, which I forgot, of what the <hi>Jacobites</hi>

And that is, That when his Lordſhip Refus'd to be an Evidence, to ſave his Eſtate, the 'boveſaid <hi>Reis-Efendi,</hi> inſulting over him, in Diſcourſe with a Noble Perſon, who well Remembers it, ſaid, <hi>we will ſee how finely my Lord</hi> Preſton <hi>can Starve!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Sweet and Chriſtian Temper, the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, he Learn'd, at leaſt Improv'd, under the <hi>Paſtoral</hi> Care of the Religious <hi>Mufti,</hi> who had ſo well Inſtructed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthinking <hi>Napleton,</hi> but met <hi>Here</hi> with an Apter and more Diſcerning Schollar: Who, like himſelf, tho' not ſo Early, Renounc'd the Doctrine of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> for the ſake of that Religion, which is Propagated by the <hi>Sword.</hi> And, as True <hi>Renegades,</hi> ſhew Zeal, for Joy of their Converſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe (the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay) are <hi>Prodegies,</hi> and Portend Ruin and <hi>Revolution,</hi> like <hi>Earth-Quakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning which, I beg leave to add a Word to what I have ſaid before, upon Occaſion of a Freſh Lamentable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; which is, that Aſtoniſhing <hi>Earth-Quake,</hi> which happned the <hi>11th. JANUARY 92/93.</hi> in <hi>Malta,</hi> and in <hi>Sicily,</hi> in the laſt of which, as our Gazzet tells us, about 150000. Souls Periſhed, and 37 Cityes and Towns Deſtroyed, ſome of them to that Degree, as not to have a Houſe left ſtanding, as in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanea,</hi> the ſeat of the <hi>Univerſity,</hi> in which alone near 20000 Perſons Periſh'd; and the Famous City of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> greatly Renown'd in Antient Hiſtory, has ſubſiſted above <hi>Two Thouſand</hi> Years, to Periſh in this <hi>Earth-Quake;</hi> and the Hideous Bellowings of Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> which, our laſt News ſaid, did then continue, Terrify'd thoſe who are left Alive, to that Degree, as to Force them to Quit their Houſes, and Fly from a new Eruption. <hi>This was Terrible!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the ſtrange <hi>Giddineſs</hi> which, as I told, Accompany'd our <hi>Earth-Quake</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> has ſomething in it, tho' not ſo Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly Dreadful, yet, perhaps more Extraordinary and Remarkable than that in <hi>Sicily;</hi> which the <hi>Jacob.</hi> think does point to the preſent Epidemical Diſeaſe of <hi>England:</hi> They have a Proverb in <hi>Italy,</hi> viz. <hi>He that Cheats me</hi> Once, <hi>it is his Fault; But if he Cheat me</hi> Twice, <hi>it is my Fault.</hi> Was it ever heard (ſay the <hi>Jacobites</hi>) that a Nation ſhould be <hi>Twice</hi> Cheated, in the <hi>ſame Age,</hi> and moſtly by the <hi>ſame Perſons,</hi> and upon the <hi>ſame Pretences,</hi> to Riſe up againſt their <hi>King,</hi> and Cut one anothers Throats; and after being <hi>Penitent,</hi> and keeping an <hi>Aniverſary</hi> Humiliation for the Murther of the <hi>Father,</hi> and Damning all
